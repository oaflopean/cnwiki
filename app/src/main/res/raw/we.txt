We will be spared the harsh critique of our Gods in doing so.
We must only await his, Artheces', transformation into the dragon.
We used to eat and drink all the time.
We watched them fly circles around our house, and prayed they would be attacked at headquarters and be forced to leave.
We're facing a triple threat.
We will be very high off the ground.
We wouldn't see the true effects for another thirty years.
We must rope him.
We learned that giants walked the Earth.
We used to work together, you and I.
We used to part the waters.
We could get them where it hurts.
We cannot wait weeks.
We need answers now.
We found where it had rained, and searched for colorful apparitions after the fact.
We live on Saturn, where the rain itself is toxic to humans.
We're the colorblind octopuses floating in Saturn's sky.
We, as space octopuses, were aware of the change because we navigated with the magnetic waves.
We were lost.
We can only say that His Noodly Appendages, our God, smiled at us the day the warships attacked.
We felt like bubbles, floating away from the earth ready to pop, silent and unseen, as the atmosphere thinned or the wind disturbed us.
We never played pool.
We never did anything.
We might not be able to see you in a month.
We'll believe in a world of make believe.
We're officially hell!
We blended, the two of us Dinosaur units, into the ridge, as the Father stopped his vehicle in the field.
We'll need a flare.
We have both units.
We got Angle , Gary.
We were resurrected for different amounts of time and at different points on the timeline, so we made ourselves into a ranking.
We're sorry, but there is a window in which you can be reached.
We're not... ... Superheroes...
We know not to harvest molecules if and when we're giant space angels, Ms. Tartus.
We spent a million dollars on this semester's storytimes and I don't think we expected a review.
We'd be inside the male strom by then, all spinning around in our hosies.
We're called skin divers; our suits are our bare skin.
We don't go up in the air, but deep underground invisibly goring the earth with our expensive drill systems.
We're recorded breaking records every day, with no limit known to physics stopping us.
We suspected it was vulnerable.
We thought we were going to jail, and we needed a cover.
We lost all our friends, and we had to do something.
We want to knock the f!&#ing paint off your stupid face!
We know that's what the tracks are for.
We ain't seen a single train since they been built.
We're gonna be face to face with the overlord's fatass guards.
We're going to hell.
We're getting married, Samsarah.
We're getting married in Hell.
We need that.
We need you to step down from robotics at the Kimberly offices.
We're mercenaries.
We train our minds with information given to us by the military, but nothing can really prepare us.
We think you're the Devil, and you steal souls on Earth and take them to Hell.
We noticed social groups forming into virtual tribes that mingled and evolved within their own microcosm.
We lived in the real world as social media spies, and gathered followers through public displays.
We don't know the source of the bow and arrow, but the weapon will most surely kill your first wife.
We were discussing the cake, I'll be damned...
We were beside a tree photographing.
We would survive this wedding, because I believed in the power
 of the bow.
We went so far East on the highway to the East Yon that maybe, we might have gone insane.
We'll need a dynamic plot, for example.
We have Jake.
We think you'll like your lawyer, Jake.
We think you'll like him very, very much.
We have created a new and improved language for use by the general population!
We don't want IN DOC TRI NATION!
We don't want IN DOC TRI NATION!
We needed a single cover guy.
We were going to create a milestone, and watch his behavior resulting the milestone, or life altering event.
We had a few ideas.
We must upload the entire research file online after getting his permission.
We had gone over the surveillance checkpoints and double checked our signals.
We could unite as one, and forever block a sound economy from being achieved on Planet Earth.
We must rope him.
We learned that giants walked the Earth.
We could get them where it hurts.
We cannot wait weeks.
