Like his own mortality.
Like Jurassic Park, whose kitchens became hunting grounds for velociraptors.
Like once a year.
Like a clogged vacuum, a sound sucked the smoke back into the lamp.
Like a condom she wore on her head to keep stinking thinking out she read the label, her head leaned against the refrigerator: TURN OFF WHEN NOT IN USE Her son, Sam what would he think when they opened the gift shop?
Like restless fevered love making, the jets created a kind of pink, purple, blue and red heat beneath the craft.
