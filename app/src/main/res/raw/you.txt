You will immediately transform once we complete the ritual.
You have been granted immortality for killing me, but do you accept?
You will become very close to him, indeed.
You're the same way?
You think they used to have solar magnifiers back in the day?
You've made it to the edge of the universe, or so you say.
You don't get one.
You're a nameless, faceless nothing in Minecraft.
You could be viral in just a with the right Android app.
You must code it with code itself, Caesar said.
You're not fit to be an elf, the elder said.
You may have heard of him.
You didn't know there are multiple sources that give us the mental thoughts and hallucination we call voices?
You see the thoughtlessness of your actions now, anthrax?
You worship me.
You're a robotic program.
You're an extremely late cycle prodigy program developed my colleagues and me at the CIA.
You're telling me we're here because a woman accidentally fell back in her chair and her face was caved in from eating too much bread, maybe?
You think she imploded when the food touched her lips?
You must be insane.
You made her famous.
You'll awaken Shidave.
You remember why you believed in me.
You kicked me out, Bryan.
You fell.
You can feel my spirit, and it is good.
You received a text.
You can't check it while driving.
You wonder what it says.
You offer the flowers as an explanation.
You have a problem.
You're paranoid and you need to get help.
You called me, didn't you?
You're not speaking to anyone of any importance.
You're in a very bad place, right now.
You don't think anyone understands.
You know me so well.
You just chill.
You haven't heard this album, my friend.
You see, the men in the other cells do not hear the music we are sending to our target.
You're coming to jail with me.
You've forgotten much in that time.
You brought me flowers on the last day we were together.
You see, when something changes in my treatment for schizophrenia, the effects eventually take hold of my entire life.
You know nothing about it, Howard.
You want a wish, Kevin?
You hearin' this, maid?
You're telling the story of your death to the ones who killed you meaninglessly, the AI system said.
You Frost Nebula people can Freeze time, then?
You know those speed traps outside of your town where you always have to slow down on the state highway or you'll get a ticket?
You may know, or you may not, that we have something very powerful together.
You're the reason we succeeded.
You never see anything about it on television.
You'll be Samsarah from now on.
You don't have a book, do you, Mr. Bean?
You're going to fire half the world.
You're getting deep into something you don't  I cut the message off.
You must have no respect to request something like this of me.
You must know we are paid well.
You get burned up.
You just try for even a piece of you to make it to the ground.
You think it's away from reality, all on its own, until your own son is against hell's maelstrom.
You watch the love of your life, exploding in the terror of the forces of hell, and reformed again, to be tortured in some other way.
You're a genius, Stacy said.
You have a lot of power over them on Earth.
You don't know where Earth is?
You don't have it quite right.
You probably don't know who I am or what I stand for.
You didn't bother calling for municipal help for infernal hauntings.
You hired the psychopomps.
You're under arrest!
You are mine.
You get privacy on those.
You cannot fail us.
You must befriend me on Facebook.
You have been granted immortality for killing me, but do you accept?
You will become very close to him, indeed.
