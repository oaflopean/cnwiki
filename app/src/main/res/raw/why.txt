Why don't you tell us where he's at?
Why did you create me in the first place?
Why was I so sad all the time?
Why wouldn't they?
Why did I come?
Why, it's something you strum upon your mustache!
Why are we fighting?
Why, it's the planet where I'm from!
Why did I notice these pixels?
Why does anyone notice anything?
Why did the trident lift and begin to rotate in three dimensions?
Why did the gladiators animate themselves, me staring, pixel by pixel, until a crowd lived in my monitor?
Why would the artifact destroy my wife when it is supposed to kill my murderer?
Why yes, darling man.
Why have you approached this platoon?
Why wouldn't they?
Why did I come?
Why yes, darling man.
