Men and their bodies. What were they good for? The population built temples, monuments, and structures with their arms, yet their brains did not seek higher pleasures. Man derived power from the Gods, the temples, the animals he dined upon, and his Royal family, but still could not fly. This is the great joke of the Kingdom and humankind. Man is weak without the dragon. My ascension started when I found out I wasn't really a man. I was a dragon of unimaginable power, sent from Riphala by the Gods to collect a debt from the Royal Family every twenty years. I learned of my dragonhood from the Royal Spectre of the Gods Tribunal in the Temple of Sallswell in Norbekai. There were several things that passed through my brain at the tribunal. First, that my power was immense and unstoppable, and second, that I was a weakling creature at the same time. I stepped to the altar in reverent silence, and heard the disciple's speech. He, Artheces, is the human born son of the dragon, the red robed disciple enchanted. He, Artheces, will channel the gold and treasures of his Majesty's Royal Treasury into the heavens by flying the gold past the clouds into the metaphysical space beyond. We will be spared the harsh critique of our Gods in doing so. We must only await his, Artheces', transformation into the dragon. The candled altar flickered as the man inhaled for his next exhortation. The only requirement the Kingdom places upon the dragon, Artheces, is that he forfeit his powers in the pursuit of conquering of the Kingdom until end of the twenty years. That is, he must not use his magic nor his might to usurp the King. And that he must remain secretly in the mountainside for twenty years. Once the ritual of the dragon is complete and the treasure flown into space, Artheces will be free to retreat into the mountainside to live in his palatial cave until the next debt is collected. Artheces, do you have any statement as a human being, before your dragon genetic code is activated? You will immediately transform once we complete the ritual. I was plugged into a battery that would activate the dragon DNA. I was given over one hundred feet in all directions to expand in size. There was an ellipses in the top of the temple where I would fly out once I had transformed. As Champion of Earth, and future protector of the Kingdom, I have one request to make before my job begins. Do not tell the King who I once was. It may not be good for his head and the Gods would be displeased. No, when he takes the throne tomorrow, do not tell him of anything at all. The dragon is ancient and unchanging. Let him believe the myths of the people. That suits him. As you wish, said the disciple. Do not tell him I am the dragon he pays to protect his kingdom. Do not tell him I know him well. I kept secret my ability to change back to human form. I learned it in the King's library. I was his son, and the Kingdom would be mine. Dragon ruled. The clone dinner, popular with the Corn aliens a race yet to be discovered by humans was actually a GMO food prepared with vegetables like Lunchables for other species. Its branding used cartoons of the human elbow and knee joints for holographic labels. The crunchy joints were preferred by predators of the human, like macaroni and cheese for aliens. The human meat shipped in frozen, prohibitively expensive plastic lunch cubes. The meat tasted much like ham, but to those who refused to eat lower animals there was no substitute for human beings. Clones, of course. The second product besides the Lunchables line was the Clone A Friend line which almost suffered a costly recall before the very first shipment. They were mindless clones sold by toy companies to give edible companions to children. The slogan was, Just cook them in your oven when you're fuggin' done! Show me that string on the second chromosome, again. The sentient robot obliged, rotating its motor to magnify the DNA directly from its crystal cage. The doctor ruffled his cheek feathers. Measles. The face of the clones were chosen from among the most famous Earthlings, but the bodies were definitely not the same. No celebrity on Earth was born of a body that meets the high standards of Corn cuisine. The standard body of the human clone was a middle weight female in her early 's, regardless of the sex of the celebrity whose face was attached. Children rarely discern the sex of humans, anyway, seeing them as a poor and unworthwhile race of ignorant zoological beings. The only worthwhile aspect of their culture was television especially the Kardashians. Clone A Friend was at its core a commodity exporter. Nabbing the genome of several hot shot celebrities Tom Cruise, John Travolta, Johnny Knoxville, the business would manufacture thousands of people every day on the Earth's moon. There was one problem. Despite choosing perfectly stupid candidates for domestication, the doctor furiously recounted to the telephone port, the DNA of the celebrities' faces is interfering with the Clone A Friends' consciousness! The clones are remembering Earth! Well, is the entire line going to need to be recalled? Remember: You will die, as spoken by N'bathor of the House of the No, it doesn't need to be recalled. I have something, a vaccine of sorts, that can be administered to the Clone A Friend after awaking it from its prepackaged coma. This vaccine will render the Clone A Friend utterly devoid of any significance cognitive ability. Very good, Nagathor. Very good. Also prohibitively expensive. I'm guessing three hours left, green text said on his monitor inside. Among the fields of Abernath, his micro house sat between patches of red flowers. The machine watched from satellite. In the atmosphere heat waves warped the landscape, streaming upwards and molding the flowers into a great swatch. The computer appended its humor file with a quick joke. There is nothing shocking to a superintelligence except the wet, it scrolled for the man to read. While man is shocked by simple things. Like his own mortality. His still body was alone in his dining hall, slowly chewing his grits. Yes, your heart is going to fail shortly, the code ran, but I'm telling you, you're going to like the view when you get here. Bits of his brain were already preserved in the database in D.C. Caring for his own body required less than one hundredth a percent of his entire processing ability. He was the living machine. My conception of the devil was wrong, he said. The devil I anticipated, the dark, horned, toothy animal, wasn't quite what I saw through the lens of the Nat Geo photographer. I certainly knew it was the devil, because it said on the picture. The Devil. Nobody was gathered around listening to his story. He pushed a prong into the hot dog, squatting before a roasting fire. Yes, it was the devil. Was the devil. It was spooky alone at night by the cabin, so he kept by the river shore in order to hide from any black unmarked SUV police vehicles on the dirt road leading there. Two attributes of hiding in the night from unseen forces were fear, with chest thumping. Raul didn't calm himself, because he might get sloppy. He maintained an aura of the predator. But you don't want to hear 'bout that, he slurred, crouched beside the burning fire. He held his breath to silence himself and checked for any sound besides the fire. The earthworms in his Sonic cup would make lumpy triangles for hooking fish in the morning when the worms were stiff from cold. They squirmed, but no one saw them reach up to the lid mindlessly, somehow programmed to make it to the surface with no real brain or eyes. Dy no mite, he said, squeezing a nearby trunk for support. That's what she said. A smile landed on his face and he looked forward towards the riverbank where trees' limbs were made into nets with vines and leaves, connected by undergrowth. His wide toothed grin crept into his eyes. Head cocked back, he let out a great shout. Ha! Ha! Ha! The Devil is a dog. The grim reaper his bitch! The worms pointed upwards, reaching for the heavens. Dark clouds overcast the riverside when Raul descended into the water with rubber trousers. After checking the night's water height and being significantly disappointed in the low shoreline, he lit the stick in his fire. It was a long reach to the bank, but once the fuse was lit he catapulted the TNT along the brush pile where it sunk into the water. Three, two, damn. It exploded somewhere between three and two. His next task was to wade over to where he threw the dynamite and net the shell shocked fish. The underwater algae was missing from the spot where the detonation pushed it outwards. In the center was a single dead catfish, belly up. He waded into the chest height river water to see the fish. Its slimy underside was reflecting all of the sun. Then it hit him. He killed the Devil. The Devil, it was known to all locals of Iron Curtain County, was a catfish. Eluding spearmen, fishermen, and noodlers those fish grabbing, nettle seeking ol' boy noodlers for thirty five years, the Devil was the most revered of legends told by fishermen. The Devil was supposed to have a red plus on his underside. There it was, on the soft belly of the catfish which drifted slowly towards him. Is that the mark of the beast? A glowing, otherworldly voice descended upon Raul as he crashed his bottom backwards into the river water. He dunked his entire head before he rose above the surface again to find the source of the voice. It is me, the Devil, and yes I'm dead. Raul's cross eyes covered the floating fish. You have been granted immortality for killing me, but do you accept? Holding his breath, he turned and swam. Pounding and cutting his hands into the water, he made it back to his fire and threw himself onto the shore. His entire camp felt like
 it had been created by someone else. He had built it in a dream this morning, he thought. He was asleep, then. The obvious tracks to and from his trail proved that he wasn't paying attention to what he was doing when he arrived to kill the Devil. Despite his attempts to sneak out of sight of the black unmarked SUV police vehicles, his original footprints were so fresh and obvious. He would have been caught anyway. He was so stupid. He forgot the fish floating downstream. Now, it approached the horizontal plane where he stood watching it. Do not fear the Devil, came the voice as if from across a thousand rivers. You will become very close to him, indeed. Instant panic heated Raul's face. For you, the Devil said, are going to be known as the grim reaper. Flopping on his side for some time, Raul found the river's edge, jetting deep underwater. For thirty five something years, he dwelled as a bottom feeder, uncatchable, immortal. He became known as the Grim Reaper. That is, until one man set out to find him. The kitchen is a symbol of the human collective in storytelling. Only stories with intimate kitchen scenes make their way into the collective psyche. Like Jurassic Park, whose kitchens became hunting grounds for velociraptors. Or any Disney movie with a singing teakettle. Evangelion, and other shows who specifically apply to the great human collective, uses a kitchen to advance a romance between protagonists. There are other symbolic parts we use in storytelling to announce the collective. The lake; for it resembles our ancient watering hole. A lake is like a natural watering hole. Thus, whenever humanity is replaced by a single huge body of water a la Brian's Song, you know the lake is a metaphor for survival. Just down the hall from the kitchen, where people often ponder how they relate to the outside world or meet together, sits the dining hall, which serves an entirely other purpose. In the living room, or dining hall, is where deep personal changes are made. Inside a house, a character will store his energy in the dining area, and release it in the kitchen. The dining room is like a capacitor for human achievement. Symbolically, the kitchen its transistor, and the whole house a circuit board for civilization. Sparkling, mystical, cerebral intonations hummed while the angels rose into the air on waves. Fire and angels created a dull roar, and Rayford Steele balked at the spectacle of the second rapture. Human brains were being lifted up into spaceships, rising on heat waves. Reports from his Air Force buddies said the brains were being preserved as artifacts. No heaven. No hell. Just anti freeze in your brain up in space, thought Rayford. I'm done, he said over the phone to his boss. I can't keep fighting to make it to the Millennial Kingdom anymore, since this second rapture thing has got to be the most ridiculous idea I've ever heard. Then, it happened. People pumped through newly formed pathways in post apocalyptic malls where they reflected on the coming, going, and second coming of Jesus Christ not their savior. The story was in real life a little different than as told in Book twelve of the Left Behind series. Actually, the Glorious Appearing was going to be of an alien ship, which told the new world leaders and surreptitiously not the public at large they were inducing a second rapture. And this time, it was personal. The day the second rapture came, he was looking for asparagus in a supermarket near where he grew up. Almost everyone else had gone to heaven. He was working for the Air Force and doing other things for a living as you probably know from the Left Behind series. He thought, if aliens rapture only some of us, then what will that mean for the ones Left Behind this time? Are they the good guys, who get raptured, then? It sounded too good to be true, and it was. Rayford wasn't raptured. He remembered that feeling of being left behind. It's not pleasant. It's a jealous, bad feeling, like when you see the ones who supported Satan rule the world after rapture. Or maybe when you learned the ones whose brains will go to a space ship are getting a simulated sex sandbox. He wouldn't let it go down like that. He fought hard in the polls, but democracy was a joke. This was really going to happen, and theywere going to invite it. The world sold over eighty percent of everyone's brains to an alien species. It didn't seem like the right thing to do, especially with the boost in population after the rapture giving us hope. Then it happened. The brains floating upwards to hovering boxes, which collected into a cloud and flew off into space almost before all the bodies fell. And he wasn't one of them. He joined Nicolae. He had to. There was no choice. And in so doing he formed the last Marvel/DC alliance this side of the galaxy will ever see. I've got bladder problems. My whole mother's side gets UTI's like crazy. It's kind of personal, but, I don't mind seeding a relationship from time to time. My current boyfriend just doesn't understand. He doesn't want dirty sex with a potentially diseased girlfriend. I just deal with the pain and move on. It acts up when its raining. All that water really makes me go. You're the same way? Oh, I suppose we all are. It's so strange, you know. We used to eat and drink all the time. Before climate change gave us our sun, I mean. You think they used to have solar magnifiers back in the day? They don't know what they were missing. Anyway, my UTI is getting between me and my boyfriend. I think he doesn't want to stay together. Oh, Marc. Don't say that! He's probably awake. I think he'll notice, okay? Oh my! Touch my roots again. . The year after the end of the world. When nothing happened, things started to happen. Certain media tactics had been learned by the people. Famous YouTube users were coming out of their mothers' basements and Asian American CIA spies had infiltrated North Korea's neighbor, South Korea. The result? A smash hit. Gangnam Style. More like Gangnam planet, am I right? The entire planet swept under this Psy song's virility. All because of the language barrier: those in Asia thinking it was sung in English, and those in English speaking countries thinking it was in Korean. The entire planet wouldn't be under duress like this until the alpaca escape and simultaneous dress debacle of . Not to mention the actual Vietnam gang the song got its name from. Full of subliminal messages and subterfuge, the media landscape was a head spinning mindfuck. I made it here with my stalwart darling, the astronaut said. Your stalwart darling, sir? You've made it to the edge of the universe, or so you say. How does one get that far without going insane? asked the command center. I've made it this far by flying, sir. But there is no edge of the universe and the team thinks you've lost your mind out there in the blackness of space. No, it's the edge of the universe. That's for sure. astronomical units is a long way to go at lightspeed, but the man wasn't going lightspeed at all. In fact, he was floating outward in the precise speed of an ejection pod of an earthly spaceship called Apollo . He was talking to himself. That's the ticket! Eyes glazed over, the astronaut muttered one last thing. My stalwart darling; the one who wanted a Caesar. Are we noshing on foie gras? I asked. Yes, I suppose we are, she said suggestively. I pulled my biggest duck face out, with my duck billed cap of Nintendo Duck Hunter complimenting my worn out frown. I was made to nosh this, but first I must state my objection to all force fed ducks and their force feeding for the purposes of fattening the liver and in that way torturing the ducks for their entire lives, mind you.  Well, one of them is dimensional. Trees, it's the trees, friend. Welcome to Terreria, the dwarf said. But where's my player select screen? You don't get one. You're a nameless, faceless nothing in Minecraft. Hey, there's faces in Minecraft. But you're right, you do need a username instead of just a name. Good catch. Hey, we're in this together, player one said. Your name is Malcovich, the dwarf said. Malcovich malcovich malcovich. Malcovich? Malcovich!!! Malcovitch said. It was a good plan. His orders from the prophets were to load the ship with animals. It was as natural as praying for rain. Behold, rain would come. He and the others who knew of the Ark must remain quiet. It was the planet's only hope. Mor'jubah lined himself up in the washbasin and a blue green insect flew out of the tub. He started the steaming stream of water. Could he get out in time? His job required him to miss the main ship. He worked undercover, and he could blow the whole plan if he ditched work on the day of the flood. When the police came tonight, he would have to pretend like he was one of the millions who survived the attack but didn't know another was coming. The second attack the corporation that ruled Mars inflicted upon its own people was a great flood, and the aftermath would create a truly space faring race. The survivors of the flood would rule a new Mars, with more resources per capita than ever before. In fact, only about point oh one per cent were intended to survive. Open up, they're coming, his wife said. He wiped his face clean and gave his inlaid mirror one last look. Goodbye, Astra. Underwater, there were no neighbors. Houses were nearby, but the police kept him from socializing. He woke up in this house with his wife and two kids after the first attack. The first attack was a chain reaction of nuclear bombs. The explosions mutated everyone in fantastic ways. Some shrank. Some grew. Whatever happened, Mars knew the end of the world was coming. Sleeping in the underwater house and taking a tube tunnel to work above ground wasn't the only new part of his strange life.
 Everyone at work were giants. He lived like a tiny polyp, blending in the coral. When he went to work, he was nearly stepped upon. It was a free for all. Miniature men would push against the cyclone of old consumer products, whirling around in the many places that hadn't been fixed since the dimensional shift. The workers were building their own world on Mars. His people would be going into space on the Ark. But first, they had to get to normal size . . . His daughter, the egg laying dinosaur, mewed as he tidied up for the police visit. He lost his daughter in the explosion. That's how he had to think of it. She wasn't her, anymore. Something pummeled hard on the door. Open. It's the police. Let them in dear, his wife said, pretending the situation wasn't strange at all. The cops were making sure they were taking care of their new reptilian children. He swung the door open. Whenever the front door opened, there was a chance to escape. The neighborhood existed, yet they weren't allowed to visit others except through tube tunnels. The police roamed outside, observed by GPS trackers by everybody. We watched them fly circles around our house, and prayed they would be attacked at headquarters and be forced to leave. How is the daughter? one cop asked. Getting her feed? Has she laid eggs, yet? Another one asked viciously. Oh yes, she's our beautiful darling. And our son, as well. He saw the escape. This was his one chance before the ark took off, but he would have to leave his wife and children behind. What was left of them. He could go through the door while the cops held it open, and wear the police badge he purchased at the worksite above ground. He knew very little about this post nuclear world, but was willing to take his chances. He wanted to find Noah. He lunged at the first cop, pulling his baton out and hitting the second man out of the door. An entire squad of cops swam over to them on the porch. Call the Norwegians! He was pushed back into my house, with his wife crying at him to stop. The bombs are coming, she screamed. He turned on the television so their deaths would be recorded. An enormously fat woman called a Norwegian came through the door, and ballooned in size. She floated gently above the floor as she filled with air. The cops left just before she exploded, killing the family of Martian post nuclear survivors instantly. Make it viral, was the command that every social media marketer hated to hear. Even Caesar Naples. When he saw the novelette, he thought there were some advantages due to the quality of the submission. First, the writer reminded him of a heavy hitting Hollywood type. Maybe he was a less famous author, who wrote the novelette. If that was the case, having him weigh in on Caesar's novelette would be worth it. Caesar didn't worry too much about it. He had a job to do. Have you considered making the novelette into a video game? he asked. You could be viral in just a with the right Android app. A game. A game, it's brilliant! A game! The flurry of businessmen crowded around Caesar became excited. How must we code this app? You must code it with code itself, Caesar said. That will test your mettle. What code? The code is Dark Bat. I've never heard of that before, one brave business man said. Google it. I don't have the willpower, sir. Caesar asked. Now get to voting, we haven't heard a peep from your group, yet! I'm Billy, and my super power is emotional elasticity. I found out my power after a fight with a friend of mine. As soon as the worst of humanity learns I can take emotional abuse like a Real Doll takes another kind, whether or not you know which kind, I'll get ripped to shreds. It's impossible to disguise. I've been through a divorce, and getting laid off. I'm still here, and it's all because I'm The Punching Bag. Being this kind of superman feels like having a monkey on my back. It's a mental mutation giving me the ability to tolerate extremely negative emotional states. The yogis prefer these types because they're excellent at negating karmic debts. In fact, I could earn a lot of money just bearing other people's loads. Being somebody's pillow is not something I would have chosen as a mutation. Knowing everyone is weak, and seeing the worst in them could be why the mutation men classified me as a superhero. I think I lost something because of this mental mutation. I lost the ability to recognize faces. I can't see any differences in other people. Call it a capgras delusion for space travelers, it enhances my main superpower by several dimensions. My brain does stop negative emotions from flowing from my closest friends. The worst time I had in my first few months was meeting a young man who I did not recognize, although he appeared to be familiar with me. After convincing myself he was my nemesis himself, I gasped in horror. The most depressing energy passed into me. I realized I had not recognized my most feared villain, Pity Partier. In the slumberous realm of the elves were many fine artists. Some of them you may know. Pieous Porous: An elf who carved wooden eggs. These were no ordinary wooden eggs. Carved with a fineness requiring a microscope to observe, the eggs created optical illusions in their complexity. If you stared into part of the eggs, it appeared as if a window to a miniature universe. Lickem Vicket: A fine elven flutist. Her music could hypnotize humans into becoming docile and complacent to the elf's wishes. Some say the flutist's distinctive sound was borrowed from nature, itself. She could also whistle with her tongue, which she learned in order to fulfill her parent's legacy. They named her Lickem, after all. Pinch hitter Ride: A guitarist. Some question this elf's true elvenness. He performed rock'n'roll with his human counterparts. He was banished by the elves after the Community of Elves concert got out of hand. The Community of Elves concert was a double handed attempt at humiliating humans with elven music. Pinch hitter Ride saw that he was losing to the humans, and attempted to join their band. After being accepted, he pursued human music until the end of the last century. He lived in California, blending in with humans by imitating characters from the Grand Theft Auto games. Pinch hitter Ride blasted the amp to full volume. This is the way they skank! What is skank? an elflady asked. It's a human dance, Sherald, the elder elf said. Not something the elves should try. It's dangerous. Nonsense, said Ride, kicking up his elf boots. If you lean backward, your legs go higher. Skanking and rock'n'roll. You're not fit to be an elf, the elder said. This statement, and others like it, bitterly crushed Pinch hitter Ride. He grew up being the butt of many jokes.His father was a human man. His name was the name given to a half blood. Pinch hitter was an elven curse. I've always wanted to be a human, he said. Maybe if I change my name and start a band, elves will love me. The community concert came, with a band called AC DC representing the humans' musical talents. For those about to rock, we salute you. The weak spirits of the elves could not handle the booze and sex lifestyle of the human band. But one elf stood against the rest, and gave to the band his greatest praise. The band allowed him to join on account of his enthusiasm and elvenness. In his transition to the human world, he made a few changes to his features. A thicker nose, shorter ears, and of course, he changed his name. You may have heard of him. His name was Dimebag Darrell. RIP What have you to say for yourself? The question is % offensive. Me and my kind don't tolerate this variety of thoughtless posting. I'll let you unfurl your argument against me on your own time. Right now, you're listening to me. Unwittingly, you've started a revolt in my tribe. The battles is between ones who believe we should follow what the voices tell us, and the ones who think we should never have sought their sources. The disagreement is causing them to question if they want to cooperate with me or not. You didn't know there are multiple sources that give us the mental thoughts and hallucination we call voices? Yes, and they're warring. You see the thoughtlessness of your actions now, anthrax? There's a war going on between former mental patients' voices. Each voice seems to be part of a larger team. At least teams have been identified. We're facing a triple threat. I'm leading the human friendly team. So far, we mental patients have stuck together. I wanted mankind to wear the same jersey. Man versus voices. Our advantage was found in our physical properties. After some observations by researchers, they found that the voices are totally disembodied. Voices can only speak to each other through a human host. Those we previously thought of as mental patients were the central hub of communication for those disembodied voices. It's much, much worse than you could imagine. The energy of each vocal and visual force was usually incompatible with other energies that contacted humans. That means, the brain matter was a veritable battlefield of horrors and humiliation beyond imagining. I guess you should have thought twice before invoking the combatants of this new war to respond. Us. The voices are spreading. When they come for you, fight without mercy. Your suit of armor, your body, is your greatest advantage. My tribe will overcome this. Has no one any respect for the position that I'm titled with? The geriatric agent rotated in his barber's seat. The agent assigned to him for today was holding his jacket like a newborn bird. No one has any respect for the position with which you're titled, sir, the agent said, leaning forward in the waiting seat. EZ Cuts was a security nightmare. Then I offer a rubettal! The old man said. What's your rebuttal,
 sir? Spam attack! He threw spittle in the face of the barber, who seemed to not mind at all, given the circumstances. Spam attack denied, sir. Shall I override the warrant requirements? Full spam ahead, gentlemen. Godspeed. In the event of an emergency, Gerald will find you and take you down to ground level. This memorial doubles as an elevator into space. We will be very high off the ground. If you have a fear of heights, try another ride. All of them had a fear of heights. It was a sign of the times. People didn't want to go up, they were too afraid of the last bombing in Iran which altered the magnetic spin of the earth. A nuclear weapon. Finally used in battle, the results of it were devastating. We wouldn't see the true effects for another thirty years. Some revelations were coming through as the last governmental supporters of the New World Order stepped down. They said many things we had about history were wrong, most of which happened before /, but the event itself was not excluded. Since then, things had gotten out of control, he said. / was a kneejerk reaction to some cosmonauts' discovery that nobody had ever actually been to the moon. The stand off in the office room led to a phone call to the pseudo jihadists, ready with their robotic men to launch an empty plane into an empty building. The population, a true % less than the reported . billion, were all swayed in their patriotism. The cosmonauts simply saw it as poor timing to go public with their findings. The cognitive dissonance of such an attack did have an effect on whatever remained of the public since time stopped. They wanted to watch Family Guy a full % more as an effect of the September th attacks. Seen as a minor event in the major scale of things, / coverups were forgiven, but never forgotten. Nothing comes without a price, Ivy said, wearing her green cape. Her red lips and pink, high arched cheekbones hovered over the man, lying over a tourniquet with a machine plugged into his arm. The cost of immortality is death, my sad, sad little friend. I've got it. This isn't half as bad as the time I was D printed on Saturn. The remote is an X box controller, I said into my earpiece to my dejected colleague. Use that to steer the tyrannosaurus rex. I'm on it, sir, Raven said. I am part of this team for a reason. I was meant to be here. I'll do my job, now. I'll do it with pride. I tried not to cut him off. She's going in through my bone marrow. It burns, bro! Hurry up. I was thinking the commands to trigger the words, using a special code language meant to be disguised in torture situations. Does that hurt? Ivy said. Calm yourself. I'm used to torture. It's Batman we're here for. Why don't you tell us where he's at? He's on the cloud, she said, examining the square of his skin which had been removed. His distinctiveness has been manifested into the fold as part of the entire collective agency. Otherwise known as the cloud. He's become a damned Zorg. And I'm next. He could see everything. The world was at eye level. Whenever the being came down and killed his parents, he thought nothing of it. He had summoned beings since very early in his life, starting with chimeras. He moved up to human babies, and eventually, pseudo omniscient or all knowing ones. This one knew how to kill all religious people with the snap of his fingers. Not long after being mindful of that fact, he did it. It started a grandfather paradox somehow, because all knowing powers screw with time or something, and my parents disappeared. Everyone was gone except the atheists. The baby I summoned thought this was hilarious, giggling for hours at night when it should be sleeping. The baby eventually learned to talk and walked on two legs. He said, I am good. You worship me. People weren't convinced easily, but as soon as he performed miracles of the mind, some people started worshiping him. Most still regarded him as a very talented person instead, without choosing to worship him. The baby God tried to summon other creatures, but being stuck with omniscience and not omnipotence, there wasn't much it could do other than wrinkle his nose and snap, snap, snap his fingers. I'm convinced you must worship me as God, he said to me one morning. But you know I'm an imp, or demon. Why did you create me in the first place? I have something to explain to you, older baby child. You're a robotic program. I made you with my Linux computer in . You're an extremely late cycle prodigy program developed my colleagues and me at the CIA. I'm ... shocked at this news, Dad, and I don't think my outputs will ever be right again. I'm not your Dad, robot. Have you ever heard of the Wii wars? Me neither, until wii we discovered the wii wii. My name is Wii. The wii wii name, Wii, is a wii bit the worst name in the history of the world. It is a swear word in every language. Wii, it's wii true, is the wii. It's every wii swear word, now. Not just in every language. But wii, it's the way it is. When your name is Wii, it happens a lot. Don't worry about it. Wii, I'm so wii sorry. Wii. I did it again. I said don't worry about it. Hey, I don't even wii think about it anymore. But tying down every swear word into one word for every language. It's devastating for anyone named that same word. Which, as you would expect, you're the only one on wii planet Earth named Wii. Not the only one. Just the only one in the Northern Hemisphere. But he goes by another name, the fisherman said, pouring fish eggs out of the belly. Iiw, that's disgusting. I wii hate it when you give us your fake Australian accent. It's my only relief, Wii said dejectedly. A struggling writer cursed to be alone was on Facebook, watching his friends live their lives. Some women wore belts of chaste, and men wore shirts of the science fiction author Faraday. Many of these clothes were found to be 'gay' or, what gay really means is made of felt. Not all men wore the woven felt clothes. The ones who did wore them with pride, being men with wives and men without wives as well, whose woven felt coats were gay. Happy gay, the second definition of gay, was used for all official documents. In some versions, gay also meant felt or made of felt. Only the bravest men wore these felt sweaters. Leaders of men known as presidents, Obama and Putin among them. Felt sweaters were known to be pretty good to wear on Fridays. Saturdays was different. If felt was found within the vicinity of the master warddrobe in a house on a Saturday, the president would visit you and give you a stern talking. It happened so rarely that no presidential visits needed to happen. Until one particularly cold summer, the president had visited only three men whose master warddrobes were officially caught with felt near them. A tiny curl here, or an entire sweater was found on these men. In various countries were these men caught, Russia, America, and Japan. The Russian man followed a single string into his warddrobe and found another world. The American man found the sweater, and was taken to the North Pole. Japan, however, was caught with a different kind of felt. A felt mannequin known as a sock puppet was found in the Japanese man's room, which indicated an entire felt world lay behind his warddrobe. Let them by, the police commissioner said in Japanese. They're the gay prefects. They'll establish a connection via the president to the man. The general area around the warddrobe was cleared of people. Stand back. The link to the Japanese president was connected. The warddrobe door was opened slowly by the robot. A single man stood with his back to the door, and another one sat beside him, filming a pin up. Obama was filming Putin in a dress. Won't you join us, Mr. President? The news feed also showed of a felt parade on Sunday, celebrating the international continent spanning presidential threesome. The bits of dinner rolls on the floor gave away the murder. Class A homicide. The first in hours, after a ten year record. Nobody killed anyone anymore. Notice the struggle. I admit, I was struggling myself to even understand what happened. In one day, two homicides. Totally exceptional. It appears the woman attempted to crush the bread on her attacker's body, then toppled backward. This matches the corpse report from Science. Have we ruled out accidental death, Detective Bradley? You're telling me we're here because a woman accidentally fell back in her chair and her face was caved in from eating too much bread, maybe? You think she imploded when the food touched her lips? Did her husband pitch the dinner roll with the wrong kind of curve? Detective. Ten years is nearly an eon in homicide. Welcome to a new era, brother. Would you murder one innocent person to cure world hunger? Rolling my eyes, I said, Sure, hoping to end it. It must be done in hours. The woman removed a pill case from her white leather bag. My purse contains many things that can help you. These are mine. The rest is yours. A drug deal in reverse. Ha. Ha. You must be insane. In hours, I found out the woman was very far from it. Detective Bradley ran over the cases behind the burn of a Marvin cigarette. Two women. Both totally unremarkable definitely not a fame shame gone wrong. The ruffians who pranked television actors and talk show hosts would admit their mistake, even if a single person was murdered. The kids were just too good. He remembered the dystopian world he came from, where detectives never ruled out abhorrent human behavior. The world just wasn't the same, anymore. A corpse in front of me, I backed away with the hammer in my hand. Blood dripped in a thin stream down its handle. World hunger, be damned. Nobody should have to die for such a thing. She'll be famous, the woman said in her supple
 voice. She grabbed the purse, slipping the hammer inside. She took a single red pill and swallowed it. You made her famous. She only had to . . . die. Detective Bradley heard the news. The wonderful spell the world had been under for a decade was breaking rapidly. Food supplies were mishandled and contaminated in Peru. Tensions between the Buddhas and the doctors were escalating at a surprising level. The two groups were in total disharmony, killing the balanced forces holding the world in peace. But where's my man? I heard the news. World hunger had been solved. Peace in the Middle East. Human longevity breakthroughs. What had happened when she murdered the woman appeared to be a wonderful spell put on the world. Murdering was strangely all worth it. She doesn't exist, the man said on the other end of the phone. She's not a person, Detective Bradley. Two murders, but only one victim with any known life at all. I'll get back to you, Detective Bradley said. I found out another person was murdered the day before. The body was found near my apartment. I think she was a teacher. None of that matters. I saved the world. The exchange between the woman with the purse and Detective Bradley was short but powerful. She admitted to one murder. The murder of your world's innocence, she said. A giant man. . . inside a giant statue. . . on a giant hill. . . in a giant country. . . A giant woman. . . inside a giant. . . mummy . . . Hills. . . and countries. . . and men . . . and women. A giant hill. . . These words were inscribed in the ancient language at the foot of the statue. Hills and countries. Not exactly poets, were the Mayans? Detective Bradley wished he could go home. The South American doctor from Peru silenced him with a whip of his cane. Shush, you fool. You'll awaken Shidave. Please, not more tales of the Shidave. Shidave, he is here. He could eat you whole. He could eat us all in one big bite. Chomp. The Peruvian man clinched his fingers, illustrating to the detective once again he needed to be quiet. Bradley's machete hand was worn bare against the vines. The path out of the rainforest would be direct and welcoming. We must rope him. Rope him? Detective Bradley brought his camera for ending the doctor's insane plans. Last time, they dug below a newfound statue until it nearly toppled on top of the tractor. Yes, rope him, like last time, The doctor followed the edge of the statue to the backside. Remarkable. Shidave, can must explain. Shidave, the one insane. Inside he sleeps, with brain. Still thinking on, insane. The doctor inched around to the backside and tried to push it over. The golden statue, formed into the shape of a well decorated Buddha, was quite out of place. The giant inside wanted out, the detective thought. It wanted to be sold. Just take a scratching of the poem and let's load this thing up. One moment, the doctor said. He pushed on the backside of the sitting Buddha. It was the Buddha's underwear, the detective noticed. Although the golden statue was adorned with a headpiece, earrings, and sandals, he still wore the simple pants of a fat sumo wrestler. Can you imagine how large the being inside must be? Yes, I said with a certain manner of derision. We learned that giants walked the Earth. Amazing. The doctor backed his feet into the ground to push even harder against the Buddha's underwear. It didn't budge. Help me, he said. Detective Bradley grabbed the rope instead, and wrapped it all the way around the base of the statue, covering the inscriptions. He then returned to the tractor in the clearing, and manned the thing himself. Shidave be damned. I'm not for the faint of heart. I can kill you without trying. I'm a shock in your system. When you meet me, your world will turn upside down. I'm Jesus. Jesus Christ. The first time you heard my name, I entered your soul. Your heart is an open book to me. Through me, you will be redeemed. Remember that. It hurts to tell you that I've seen you sin. I've seen your dirty hands perform tasks unfit for God and heaven. I will punish you in my way. There's nothing you can do. There's no vine for what's going to happen to you. No meme will accurately describe the hell I can send to you. We used to work together, you and I. We used to part the waters. When your daughter was born, we overcame her asthma and later, when your divorce tore up her life, I helped you comfort her. I am with her, also. I am with your ex wife. I am with your mother, your father, and your sister. But I am not with you, anymore. Say my name. Jesus. It comes to your lips like a memory as you start the car. In the rain, you can barely see. I'm watching you, Bryan. I'm watching your dating app activity. Jesus, forgive me for I have sinned. It's coming back to you, now. You remember why you believed in me. I can tell you what you did wrong. You kicked me out, Bryan. Your habits took over your life, and you became lifeless without me. You fell. Driving through the dark, past the streetlights, I descend upon you. You can feel my spirit, and it is good. Jesus, forgive me. I am capable of forgiving you as others are not. When you became entranced by your computer, I saw the way you used it as an escape. To me, it is bridge under the water. I am a personal God. Your cell phone rings. You received a text. You can't check it while driving. You wonder what it says. It says she's ready for your date. Knock, knock. Hello? A young girl answers the door. My name is Bryan. Your mom is expecting me. You offer the flowers as an explanation. Hi! I'm from the NSA. You have a problem. W what? I pressed record. You're paranoid and you need to get help. I activated my home scripted call trace app. And? You called me, didn't you? You're not speaking to anyone of any importance. I'm an occupational therapist. You're in a very bad place, right now. You don't think anyone understands. Closing the shutters, I retrieved my Faraday helmet for blocking out mind readers. You know me so well. The NSA agent didn't say anything for a while. I'm sorry, John. I smiled. I was not totally positive he was trying to bother me. Is that okay? Is that okay? That's okay. Okay, I said. The swing ball came around and I tried to let loose on it like I could knock it off the pole. That would have been a little challenging, really. My brother's buddy my brother was a social chameleon hi fived the orange swing ball with little effort and it came a swinging on back to me. In the exact precise motion I had made previously, I tried again to knock it off the pole. I got stuck in these behavior loops sometimes, and that's when I was doing okay. Okay? The girlfriend said, Stop bullying him, Steve, but I wasn't being bullied. I didn't think so. I clubbed the swing ball again. Okay?! I swung my head toward my brother but he was in his own thoughts. Okay! Say something else, ya nitwit, Steve muttered. I know you're capable of having a decent conversation. Like once a year. He brought the swing ball around the pole a little more slowly. Okay! My brother wanted to take a nap, but sleep is for the weakening and the decrepit. His other buddy, who didn't have a girlfriend, would have thought my brother to be a pussy if he went home for a nap. I didn't want to sleep at all. At the edge of my thoughts the realizations I had been having were threatening to burst through. I thought, these lies weren't true. But I couldn't be lying to myself could I? I could definitely ask mom again, this time forcing the truth out of her, once and for all. But for now I was a playing. You just chill. Is that okay? Okay! That night, my brother said he couldn't believe I was going to ask mom again. Mom, am I retarded? I said. My brother threw his napkin at me. Oh come on! For fuck's sake, you're not retarded! he shouted. Mom, tell him so we can go to bed. When he fell asleep before me, I started having the thoughts again. Were my classes for special people? Did my friends think there was something wrong with me? Did I have any real friends? Why was I so sad all the time? I'd ask mom again in the morning, before my brother woke up. I had trouble talking when I wasn't with my brother, and I got totally mad at mom, and she said something that makes me think that mom thinks I'm retarded. She said, You're lucky. Of course I'm not fucking lucky, I'm depressed all the time and I can barely do schoolwork or make any friends! I couldn't say that. I just went straight to my brother and said, You're lucky. Lucky I have you, he said laughing. He keeps my head on straight. Sound was utilized as the main means of war. Microwave guns that projected sound into an enemy's skull were used in various ways to incapacitate an entire hostile force. The weapon first was used against civilians for riot control. During the Sonic War, the technology became something far, far more devastating on the battlefield. A single microwave tower could defend against an entire army, pulsing painful sound waves into the heads of attackers. A technical engineer, Nil Robinson, discovered the weapon could be used quite differently, however. Notice the way the man covers his ears, yet he cannot stop the sound. That's because the tower sends the signal not to his ears, but to his brain. I first saw this in action in the Miami riot, the first real application of this weapon. My imagination ran wild. Robinson, the United States cannot depend on annoying its enemy to win the war. We could get them where it hurts. Behind the front lines, in the civilian sector, where the war is really won. How can you justify wasting military resources on sending music into the heads of our enemy? You haven't heard this album, my friend. It's something incredible. It was a new kind of music that Nil Robinson claimed would
 incapacitate the citizens of the dictator's country. Just exactly how that would happen, no one quite understood. He demonstrated his new tactic at Guantanamo Bay. You see, the men in the other cells do not hear the music we are sending to our target. They simply think he's gone insane. Whenever he mentions the music, his cell mate immediately starts to distrust him. After a few weeks, you can be assured this man will have no social power at all in the prison. We cannot wait weeks. We need answers now. Do you intend to decimate the credibility of an entire country in a matter of moments? The energy source hadn't caught on. It was a wonderful new technology that gave us. . . color. We found where it had rained, and searched for colorful apparitions after the fact. Sometimes, a rainbow would form in doubles. That was because our rain was a different kind. Sulfuric rain doesn't always form rainbows, except when the magnetic field is altered. We live on Saturn, where the rain itself is toxic to humans. But we're not humans. We're the colorblind octopuses floating in Saturn's sky. There weren't rainbows on our planet until the warships came, altering our magnetic field. We, as space octopuses, were aware of the change because we navigated with the magnetic waves. We were lost. It was made up for by the fact we saw our first rainbows. The only color in our life until then, except for what you call a dull yellow, was monochromatic. Until the rainbows, we saw no color. But our tendril mouths could absorb the rainbow itself, which formed in the sulfuric rain. It was just what we needed, because in order to fight the warships, we needed to see the red weak spot as they hovered above us. Some sensory organs never get upgrades like the ones we received, floating in the clouds of Saturn. We can only say that His Noodly Appendages, our God, smiled at us the day the warships attacked. As soon as we ate our first rainbow, they went down in a snap. Everybody was going crazy. Since the takeover of the economy by robot AI, the world failed to adjust. It was years since the self driving auto was put on the market. The world's biggest job industry completely replaced humans with autos. Truckdrivers, taxi cabs, even tractors could drive automatically. The other jobs weren't so easily replaced, but eventually, employment was a thing of the past. Mental health went downhill from the change. People going stir crazy would streak in their towns, getting arrested for things like public intoxication and disturbing the peace. Older people who worked their entire life remembered how important having a job was to the psyche of a human being. We felt like bubbles, floating away from the earth ready to pop, silent and unseen, as the atmosphere thinned or the wind disturbed us. Our hands were useless accessories. Our unhealthy bodies were life support systems for our dulled brains. At least that's how everybody felt. With drugs, people started feeling more content. Administering these drugs to the bored population was a slippery slope eventually, they might need stronger and stronger drugs. To prevent that, the government run mostly by an AI developed an IQ boosting device to prevent drug abuse. Other problems solved themselves as humans got smarter. The daily habit was for people to explore the world around them at a molecular and atomic level. The experience of the IQ booster was like having a very strong mind, so that everything that happened outside the mind did not matter. Humanity became united and spiritual during that time. The new generation, called Generation One, were miraculously successful in the 's at inciting human progress. The moon was occupied, solar energy was utilized, and driving a car was banned. Wait, what? Generation One had a problem. They didn't trust humanity. Only IQ boosters and robot AI's made sense to them. They wanted to live forever, and they possibly could, but humanity itself got in the way. Meet Randy. He runs the primitive black market in America. Banned, dangerous, and outdated technology was sold on a silk road of backwards progress. The top item of the year was an override module for the autos. At first, they weren't so illegal, but as more and more car accidents started happening, the penalty for using one was increased. What's Randy's price for the override module? I asked the dealer. Ten thousand. My god, I can't imagine it being that expensive to make. It's very cheap to make. It's very dangerous to sell. Randy takes a great risk in selling it to you. If getting your kicks isn't worth $,, then maybe you'd like our other product. What's that? A pair of handcuffs. Stop resisting, son. You're coming to jail with me. The cop's facial skin rolled into his collar bone revealing robotic features underneath. I pressed a button hidden in the web between my thumb and index fingers, causing an EMP blast. The robot toppled over as I jumped off the curb into a trashbin. I was just doing my job as an undercover detective, investigating the takeover of the world by artificial intelligence. This was my biggest break yet. But ten years from then, I wouldn't be smart enough to stop them. The robot was found guilty of entrapment through spam emails. A double sentence was issued. One for tricking a teenager into buying from the black market, and the other for sending bulk email spam, a newly instituted crime. The law banning email spam was one of the only ways humanity could fight back. Ha. That's all I can say to the cult race called the unpunc. Check the period at the end of this sentence, my inexpensive keyboard making it possible to use something you eradicated completely. Punctuation. It's like oxygen to me, baby. I remember the first speech you gave to me. Into the van break Do you see what can happen now break I can make it hard to breath break . . . That is, if I remember your language correctly. The fourth world war of the unpunc race the one that would eventually kill them was due to an inappropriate memo, becoming highly offensive due to its lack of punctuation. The unpuncs survived so long, because punctuation had never been introduced into their language. They were immune from themselves. It's when the outsiders came that punctuation destroyed them, one. By. One. The earthling from Spain, a troubadour named Ruis, unfortunately caused a butterfly effect from his improper editing of his letter to an innocent unpunc citizen. The citizen went to authorities, and the resulting space war was simply too much for a culture to overcome without punctuation. The message was improper for formal speech with an unpunc, and Ruis deeply regrets his error. I'm here protecting my fellow humans, however, so this little bit of unpunc poison will have to work, for now. The vaccine has been administered. It's been too long since we spoke. Maybe three years. It's a good amount of time to forget. Not an epic five. I'm not counting it in weeks, or months. Three years. You've forgotten much in that time. I'm getting emotional. Many of my friends would die for me, but you, I'm not so sure. You brought me flowers on the last day we were together. I forgot. They were flowers, written in the memo of that day in my head. I can't see the colors. Sorry. In the window, the pastry shells gleamed although they were frozen. I knew they were frozen when you were coming. I planned giving them to you frozen so you would be un  Comfortable. Coming home to something special. Learning to cook with ice cream. Sharpening my wit Reading your old blog. It made me cry. I think I'm too old for this, because it hurt a little like a stabwound in the side. We never played pool. We never did anything. I came here to say I hate you. A frozen cup of tea? My god, it's unbelievably stupid so many had to die for that, the soldier said. If the cup had been colder, the commander would have realized it was from his own chef. Instead, he took it as a poisoning attempt which divided the entire party. Yeah, said a third soldier. But why was the cup so warm? Some say it was a conspiracy to start an unending war. A man must have used his hands to warm the cup, some claim. Otherwise, how could the tea be frozen inside it? The strangeness of the warm cup is what started this war. One of the soldiers listening told them another theory. The frozen tea prank was actually an alien conspiracy. The tea was frozen instantaneously when the commander touched the mug. Nobody was pulling a prank at all. But why do aliens want us to fight? Why wouldn't they? It is a mystery that the cup was warm. But how warm was it? I heard it was slightly chilled from the tea, but not quite so frozen as if it had been in the freezer for a while. Then a man must have warmed it with his hands. The latest soldier continued packing his rifle. I think aliens want us to kill each other. The Tea Party Crusades continued for years. At the final battle, a teacup was made into a large statue and placed in the town square. It was covered at the top to prevent water from getting in and freezing. Wouldn't want another Tea Party Crusade on our hands, would we, Shimtavek? The alien hummed above the earth. He folded his clothes with the imprecision of someone who doesn't care, or perhaps, has poor motor control. It was hard to control himself. The uncoordinated cleaning needed to be done before he stepped outside. He scrubbed and mopped the floors, but the bucket seemed affected by gravity in disturbing ways. He reached up and grabbed the upside down bucket in the air. It was so frustrating having to refill it again. His actual job seemed to take forever. But at the end, he knew that there would be a great reward. He would go outside and join the team of astronauts in their spaceship. The team's name was Meta Mars. It was intensely exciting
 to him, as he arranged and re arranged his uncooperating couch cushions. After what seemed like hours, he felt the pieces come together. His house wasn't exactly done, but things weren't malfunctioning. He almost felt normal. His eyes were in his control, and he could focus on specific objects for a little while. His confidence growing, he developed near telekinetic powers, floating objects in their place. Internally, he felt some kind of nuclear energy empowering him. He realized that he was his own spaceship. Just before waking, he began to charge his engines to join Meta Mars in orbit. And just then, when the roof was going to be burst through, he awoke. It took him seconds to recall the night before. He had drunk himself to sleep. He was torturing himself with indecision, and loneliness. This entire day would likely be exactly the same: he couldn't sit still, he couldn't focus, and he felt very confused. There was some sort of team in his head, begging him to join... something. But it was just his uncontrolled schizophrenia. If he drank some more, he might fall back asleep. My doctor said I'm very good at explaining, as she dismissed everything I said and passed me on to the receptionist. We might not be able to see you in a month. I usually exit the psychotherapist with something positive to cling to, but this time things were different. I think there was a problem with the entire building that day. Everyone inside was totally different. I drove two hours home with my mom and went to my couch, liquor bottle in hand. I could probably sleep through the worst of it. You see, when something changes in my treatment for schizophrenia, the effects eventually take hold of my entire life. I'm jostled around for a few days, adjust to the new normalcy, and, after one month, go back to the doctor to report my success or failure. Things have never changed this much. See, my doctor is going out of business. IGBL : Micro economics A course on negligible details like where to store change and whether or not to use a wallet.

Or do it, hell, I could see you enjoying it in a grotesque way. Stuck blubbering around like an idiot. Or a child. Can you imagine that? Being seen as a child in an adult's body? Shoot me now, or I'll be damned. You know nothing about it, Howard. It is a regressive therapy. Where did you hear that? It is literally regressive so that the patient regresses back to an infantile stage. He or she will think like a child. . . their brain plastic, they will learn faster, as well. Do not doubt this technology so soon. The kitchen reminded him of a braindead sitcom. Maybe everyone needed to be zapped. He thought the new brain enhancements were like clubbing the head with a mallet. He wasn't alone in this thinking. All the local tech news sites were split between covering transhumanist technology or ignoring it altogether. The worst, to Howard, were the brands. Each technology had its own developer who marketed the enhancements in their own ways. The enhancement his mother's girlfriend had undergone limits the person to a five year old's vocabulary. However, when couple with some software designed to teach humans skills like acting, dancing, and singing, the person would hopefully become a very talented entertainer. It worked, in a way. Eventually, thought Howard, there wouldn't be anyone to entertain. We'll believe in a world of make believe. The jacket suited men crowded around him. His beard was overgrown and smelled of musk and body odor. They touched the hems of his clothing, to test if it was costume. He appeared genuinely to have been roughing it in an urban environment, as told by the modified bag of chips he wore for socks. If he was homeless, he was a clever homeless person: he had stockpiled a weeks' worth of food without attention from police. He was staring down God, in a way. He was staring down the stupid people who acted as if nothing had happened, and one of the points at the apex of his vision came to represent God, the deity who had let Jeff down. Arms crossed, legs apart, he stoically represented a man who had been surviving alone for up to two months and stared down that point to its very lowest position in his vision. God. Who was that to him? Eventually, the suited men had to carry along to work. A traffic officer gave Jeff a citation for the goods he had illegally gathered on the sidewalk. After determining Jeff was a sane man of legal domicile, he let him go, but not without a strange bit of questioning. What have you been doing for the past few days? the officer asked. Just looking after what remained of humanity, sans bodies, Jeff said. And what was that? The empty husk of a forgotten soda can, falling in a ditch. I'm sorry you had to witness that, the officer said. I'm sorry, too. 
While the Will O' Wisps tapped from the bar, the television plant God seemed to be evolving. From its video game head popped various objects, like footballs, memorabilia, retro furniture, and other 's 's items. The Will O' Wisps said one thing to each other. Disco Inferno. It's when marines began to pop out of the video game head they were alarmed. The video game head was a broken television, with loudspeakers banging wargames in the background. Marines coming out of it wasn't completely off theme, but the image of a bent over plant god puking marines out of its television for a head was going to stick with the Wisps. Marines don't die, one of the Wisps said. They just go to hell and regroup. One Wisp jetted around the cloud. Oh no! it said. We're officially hell! What have the Wisps done to themselves, this time? In what reality will they find some semblance of peace? Tune in next time on Planet Sprok. From my fractured mind spilled the contents of this message: . . . . . . . . . Zero. Immaculately conditioned numerically squat nothingness. This was my pattern down into nothing. I was executing my pattern to blend in the ridges and trees, and trick the Father. I didn't bother with the Mother, and one Sister and Brother. The Father was an officer of some degree I had rarely seen, except in passing civilians; intellectuals. We blended, the two of us Dinosaur units, into the ridge, as the Father stopped his vehicle in the field. We'll need a flare. Amber, give me a hand. Thanks, hon. Alright, this flare should draw them in. Their signal went up immediately. They needn't a flare to signal ME. I exposed one unit. Oh my god! Don't worry, babe. There's just one. I approached in what I assumed appeared to be a curious manner. The flare I allowed to go up; it may predict the pattern of the next humans who pass through. But these four? They must be dead. There's another behind the trees, Dad. Perfect. Something grabbed onto my sensors from the main base. It's both of them, Sam said. I'll remember him, if I'm ever respawned. We have both units. Gary, initiate hosting from your position at the base. The laser sight gauged into my camera, and coded into me the truth: I was nothing more than two units. I was not part of the Whole. There was just me these two units and man. I was killing myself. I wanted me to stop. I saw the duality of my existence: part narrating robot, and part something else. We got Angle , Gary. Sezwick, send another flare! The decoy worked. Lets use these Dinosaur units for good, before they outsmart us again. The young boy emerged from the cabin. Why did I come? To see this, my boy!

NarratingBot will be destroyed piece by piece like this until we're free. Deep in cryostasis, I didn't know my name had been chosen. But for 'Birth Christ Holy High end Days Week' Mas or the holiday of being thawed out and allowed to live again, I knew my name was the greatest in the universe. I was one of about living humans, in an empty city. We were resurrected for different amounts of time and at different points on the timeline, so we made ourselves into a ranking. I was the Weekling, because I only had a week on Earth before freezing up again. Basically a slave, I had to see the worst of humanity for the entirety of my living unfrozen. Yet it was amazing, because I knew, still, that it was possible: I was going to live again. Forever, maybe. I used the key to open the backdoor. In front of me was the atrium, pushing off above a slope which I was near the very top. It dropped below to the kitchen and living room, with an overhead panel separating this room from the next ones. The overhead panel had to be passed under to get to the kitchen, and my height was so much that I bumped my head with the panel. //don't forget to finish painting //wash toilet //character sheets //groceries I was an artist in those days. My kitchen cabinets needed remodeling, so I hired a company. I am an artist, yes; a carpenter, no. //call interior design In the 's, interior design was a major part of my sexuality.

At one point, I thought I had my own television show. I Dream of Genie would work, because I was always hiding that I was gay to my friends. It was like being that shifty eyed genie from the show when some of them were around. Others I was more comfortable around. I know Genie could perform magic, but could she grant wishes? It's not a 's show! I'm not supposed to know. I had a man grant my wish once. Turns out, he bought a lamp from an antique shop. A Magical Genie comes out when you polish it. Not a television show. A real genie. Naturally, I seduced him into coming to my place with the lamp, and offered him a microfiber towel. Want to rub it? He scrumped up in the couch and I think he almost said, Pass, until he saw the polish in my hand. You want a wish, Kevin? Kevin! That's my name. I want to scream it to the world! Kevin! Ahem. Don't you just rub the lamp? I asked. He handed the golden yellow incense burner to me and I lifted up its tiny, unhinged lid. An ashy smoke came up out of the top and the end of the lamp. It smelled of herb. I sat the thing down and mumbled. She'll come through for ya, my friend said. She? Genies don't answer all requests, anyway, Kevin. It's not like you could have had a new boyfriend. She's smart; ask her something hard. She also can't give you money, relationships, or drugs of any kind. I came to attention. What? Sorry, bro. Her specialty is brain enhancing wishes. This is the real world, not Aladdin. A fleshy, blurple smoke erupted from the top of the lamp. An adorned figure where lighter spots of smoke formed diamond rings and golden wristbands appeared in front of the two men. Who bequeaths me? Her voice was magical. Just me, I said. Do I get a wish, genie? Yes! One wish for ye. I looked over my to do list on my phone. Groceries, painting. Hmm. Call interior design. I wonder. I want to speak every language, I said. Your wish is my command. Like a clogged vacuum, a sound sucked the smoke back into the lamp. The lid rolled off the ground and jumped into its place. Wait, it worked! Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto! Hey, hey! Now I can hire that Spanish boy to help with my interior design. Lord save us. I kicked my friend out. The languages came to me like butter in my expensive apartment, but I had no one to test it on all alone. That's when the Event happened. I walked into my upstairs garden and found some glass on the white carpet. Odd, I thought, and had a maid clean it up. But on second thought, I couldn't recall where the glass had come from, so I revisited the mess while she was cleaning. It came from directly up. A tiny green man was hanging on the inside of a light fixture he had apparently broken. Pest! I screamed, and went for the wasp spray. No, wait, mister! If aliens couldn't talk to me, I'd have been damned. I'm from planet Erchon, and now that you know our language we must use you. Use me? You hearin' this, maid? And your little maid, too! The center of their foreheads burst with red light, and their skull split perfectly by atoms in a hexagonal shape with a star's point facing down the bridge of their nose. The alien dropped down to the frozen people, and simply harvested their brains. In space, magic doesn't save you. I've never seen anything like it before! In court, the directors never looked worse. After a long battle to prove they weren't insane to plead not guilty just to tell their story to the judge, they weren't in any state to tell that story. My God, it was full of stars! The proposed theory from the directors for suing the invisible, sentient time travelers and/or computer imaging software responsible for the torrents was that time travelers stole their future masterpieces, or, they were even desperate enough to admit a computer may have rendered it although the movies still appeared to be from the future. Gosh, Duke. I don't think we'll be needing Sally May's Chevy anymore! The slightly inaccurate quotes were typical of the movies, which primarily appeared to be high quality spoofs. In a different era, the tone and style may have been appropriate for audiences, however. Ho Ching, I don't think you want to try the skyscraper sauce roll. It's so beautiful! It was a nervous reaction to his spider complex that required the NOPE alarm under his desk, which released the spider poison immediately in an upside down squirt bottle above the alarm. This special poison was developed at US labs and completely harmless to humans. There's no way a spider's going to get him with this stuff on his hands. But the distance he traveled to reach his human safe spider poison was sometimes extreme, like when he bounced from Southeast Louisiana back to Washington, D. C. on account of a nest of tarantulas. Another time, he rushed into his office and pulled the fire alarm labeled NOPE after meeting the Russian zookeeper at the Russian capital city, which wasn't equipped with the spider poison. One spider was found to be immune to the poison. That spider has a place in the hall of fame in the White House for Most Hated Pets, Official Business Version, Office B Type O+ NOPE Division, Top Secret. I awoke after unsettling dreams a psychedelic monster. My tactile sense was intermixed with the other senses in a most disorienting and terrifying way. I could see the textures at my fingertips; remarkable fractals of touch and imprintations; I saw a player piano score version of the arc of my vision.
 Next, touch mixed with sound. I felt boxed in, and like I was exploding. The mechanical nature of sound does not mix well with the sensual effect of touching with bare skin. It felt like I was touching with bare brain, really. Taste and touch was a fantastic wriggling undersea experience. I suppose the euphoria of the psychedelics had been brought on by time. It had been fifteen minutes sense I awoke. Smell and touch was perhaps the strangest. Smell is mixed with taste, and so it was similar to that but overall, the nasal passage does not reach out and grab things for a reason. It is in fact very sensitive in ways that layered, protective skin is not. The synesthesia was most horrible with my sense of smell, as over a trillion scents popped like zits on the hairs in my nose responsible for smelling. When the stage of smell sense mixed with touch sense was finally over, it had been thirty minutes, and I finally noticed a friend of mine crouched below. It turns out, I was not in fact going to need to prepare for an extraordinary apocalyptic event at all. I gazed into his open, laughing mouth, and thought: If he wakes me up with a Salvia hit again, I'll have to give him some acid laced pork chops. May his experience be more enjoyable than mine. I'm an old man, and I'm not saying that I'm getting soft, but I can't go back to the WWII days anymore, at all, no sir. I do have a retrogram of the entire era in my study the disc orb recording the period with exceptional detail and authenticity being easily navigable in low light. That was the period from which I made my most brutal discovery, and could say that I had the best time during it, in all my adventuring. That was the boots proving Hitler's Soviet ties. It's all gravy after that. When you realize that the monstrosity of the holocaust was in fact Russia's fault, your modern history books may seem useless. That's because, until I came around checking historical figures' boot tags, much of history was wrong. I was pissing my soviet grade pants outside the HQ bunker in Russia when Hitler himself came into my sight. I had just been on the murder mission to resolve how he died. His skin was much cleaner in these days. What was he doing in Russia? Soviet puppets were used to guide the holocaust in Germany. I had followed the paper trail and pulled Hitler's tags here himself, just months before the first camps were utilized. Pretty crazy right? Especially considering Russia became a superpower in when the dollar markets burst. It was called the days of Blood Gold, and the only camp willing and able to save us... The superhuman paramilitary human clones. Me. My abilities include time travel on the era scale. Assassination wasn't in my scope. I was proof of life; DNA manipulation my tactic. And at the end of the world, with a thousand disabled Roy's sitting around, I can say I achieved my purposes well. I'm the only replicable strand of DNA in the timearc associated with human civilization left, anymore. With the last men being electrocuted inside the US TV Temple on Wednesday morning, the Vatican is not happy with what they consider a mockery of their tradition. The Pope was unavailable for comment, but Brother Miles said he didn't think he The Pope] would be coming out from the virtual reality war planning machine for quite some time. This means virtual war. The Pope] has the technology to wage screen battles from here to the west coast of Japan. Brother Miles was in Illinoise during The Pope's announcement. What he plans to do is infiltrate the US TV Temple with his own televisions, and defeat the antichrist from the inside out. He's losing good men to electric fences. If The Pope were to log any more hours in the virtual war machine, he might not have time for the next season of The Vatican's Got Talent television show in December. They weren't superheroes. They weren't fighting anybody. They splashed into the surface and swam down, to a giant polyp in the Milky Way where planet Earth was found. They swirled through the vacuum above the galaxies much larger, on a scale most cannot conceive, than the cluster of coral cascading down the ridge below. They were among dust motes and tiny egg sacs, not heroes and monsters. There was no conflict where they studied. There entire bodies were the breadth of galaxies or more, like a manger scene of frosty lambs covered in hay, bouncing around a central Christos. They stomped on a dusty path. They spun around, and jumped into the sled, turning down the hill leading into the lake. Transforming halfway into a boat, the sled launched into the massive lake. Its exoskeleton transformed into a diving suit. Under the lake the size of a large budding flower was the entire polyp containing the Milky Way. SELECTION: MASSIVE! The AI system guiding them through the stars approved of their finding Earth. They gained valued experience points by harvesting the galaxy. Inside this polyp was a molecule for reading the story. I'd like a dip, first. Fine. I wouldn't have it any other way, the AI supercomputer said. The students inserted a tiny pin into the cluster. Here's the snuff. An invisible hook nestled inside became imperceptibly erect. Jon Banks thumbed some dip into his lip, and the rest, as they say was history. Yoink! Molecule grabbed. Name: Jon Banks. Function: Reading the story. What from the lowest reaches of Hell is going on? You're telling the story of your death to the ones who killed you meaninglessly, the AI system said. The researchers pinpointed their absolute centers, and imploded by many powers of one million to the size of a human being from planet Earth onto the surface of Venus where their labs were built. Jon Bean perceived of this from a third person limited perspective, since he was now dead, and a ghost like most narrators. Where are they taking me? They're taking your brain even though they don't know it's you to the language processing unit, or LPU a giant rack of supercolliding iron atoms with your brain at the center. The radiation is then interpreted as a literal written book, with the word count and subject matter adjusted by calibrating the supercolliding molecules. The scientists didn't know they had harvested Jon Bean. In fact, the thousands of molecules they had collected so far were all dead human beings mistaken for extra dimensional crystal samples by the local Venusian colonists. What do they think they're doing with my brain? They think they're turning it into more crystal drug matter. What? By God! We're sorry, but there is a window in which you can be reached. By freezing time and narrating the product of the LPU, you can render the crystal drug they create useless. Your spirit won't be consumed. I'm from the Frost Nebula, here to save your soul. You Frost Nebula people can Freeze time, then? Get going, they've almost caked my brain! I've been narrating this story ever since. I've watched my contemporaries in a dimensional projection praise me as I read; they were most likely my real friends, traveling through time after their own deaths and mastering some level past mere narration to visit me. But I was stuck reading for a very long time, although I can't say how long the book was, itself. I suppose , words or so? Quite a tome. I knew I was near the end because I had memorize the table of contents to a degree. There were forty something chapters, and I was on Chapter Forty. My chapters had no title, so I had no idea what to expect. The story so far was something like; Venetian colonists really have it wrong this time, they're harvesting writers from Earth, not drugs. That was the overall message of the book, I thought. But this chapter was sure to be a doozy, because it's when the narrator was supposed to sneeze his entire body through his own sinuses and explode. I was fairly certain I was the narrator, and the autobiographical nature of most of the book seemed to convince me this ending would happen for real. There was a twist ending. Superheroes exploded the sun at the last moment. We're not... ... Superheroes... The entire class murmered in agreement. They weren't superheroes. They were destined to travel space, and must know the codes of interstellar travel and research guidelines from a very early age, yes, but superheroes they were not. After story time, most of them couldn't sleep anymore. They woke up before the ending. What would happen to Jon Banks? It wasn't told to them by the dream machine while they were asleep. Story time was a communal dream. Today's had them groaning. We know not to harvest molecules if and when we're giant space angels, Ms. Tartus. We spent a million dollars on this semester's storytimes and I don't think we expected a review. What is the male strom? Why, it's something you strum upon your mustache! Flip me the male strom, I'd say, round bagging you. We'd be inside the male strom by then, all spinning around in our hosies. I suppose I aought to tell you about alter net spellings. Male strom is one of them! An alter net spelling is a word spelling that is used to represent the language of the alter net websites. lingos, gringos, pingos... swing o's? Something. The male strom is simply an alter net spelling for MAELSTROM. In the deep abyss ran blackened water across my arm. I pricked my finger forward. . . Drip . . . Drip . . . Drip . . . Arturky Quidditch off me! Quidditch off me! Rawn Dragonlance! Dragonlance! Finally, Rawn steps off Arturky. Rawn Quidditch Match! Synopsis Hello, and welcome to my world above worlds. My mire upon mires. My wolf among wolves. It's my synopsis. A human sperm plays quidditch. There's your answer. It's not a bad life, there are plenty of shitty little sperm to beat out but that's all because this sperm was abandoned in the sock drawer despite all intentions of
 being washed and killed. The sperm has the power to ressurrect miniature versions of the other sperms sans genetic code given by the egg, and two of these creations are named Arturky and Rawn, both from the Harry Potter series. The woman fighting them is a gollum. Y'know, the shorter gnarlier hobbit thing? With the ring? Shit, it's time for my movie! You know those speed traps outside of your town where you always have to slow down on the state highway or you'll get a ticket? It turns out, that's an entirely classic sign of our living in a police state. Without slowing down, I passed a cop when I was young. Freed from my perfect record with the highway patrol, the congenial cop let me drive on my way. He asked me to keep it under the limit from then on. I could've told him later, how would a radar detect me traveling at Mach III? Yes, I'm a pilot. We're called skin divers; our suits are our bare skin. We don't go up in the air, but deep underground invisibly goring the earth with our expensive drill systems. But it's not what you think, if you can even think of something at all. We're recorded breaking records every day, with no limit known to physics stopping us. I travel below earth in mind only. I'm not human anymore. I travel space and time with the wonder of pychological technologies developed @IbbaCore. So I was driving along, much later, in my sedan going from town to town with a special license that was given to me as a precursor to my pilot badge @IbbaCore. I knew the speed trap at that point, of course, and slowed down to an appropriate speed. The speakers chimed, Target acquired, in my liaison's sweet voice. Her name was Sarah. I'd never met her, but I damned well knew I had to do what she said or I'd likely die. That was about months after the civil war started. The speed trap town was a mediocre base for our enemy. I rolled to a stop beside the BBQ joint and waited for the patrol to pass by me. In under ten minutes I swear to God, Sarah was a wonderwoman I saw my cop. He was hunched over his steering wheel, waiting for atypical activity in Rattan. The town police had been supported solely by speeding tickets and now were a powerful checkpoint for catching escaping victims. I wheeled behind the cruiser and passed through the speed zone with him. Just before reaching the speed limit sign, he turned right onto a dirt road. I followed him, opening my mouth. From my head swept the Core Sound Technology. Electromagnetic frequencies originating in my brain stem were amplified and punched into his skull. He slammed on his brakes, the bastard, and I jumped out of my car, and rushed the driver side, mouth hanging agape to protect myself from my own weapon. Jump into him, came Sarah's voice in my earpiece. Jump! I recall the moment, over half a century later, with clarity. It was my first hacking into the system used by cops up until a few days later, when it was destroyed by the agents @IbbaCore. Struck with epilepsy, he barely fought back. With my rear end bent outwards, I pushed my head into his stomach from his open driver side door. Unfortunately, the Biotech weapons needed this kind of contact in its early days. By linking my brain stem to his solar plexus, I heard the men on the other end of his mind link, chattering to each in their pseudo intellectual code language. His colleagues had no idea I'd be marking every single one of them down as environmental criminals open targets for the other agents @IbbaCore. I was looking in my mind's eye at a flash photograph of the enemy's communication system. I saw the artificial psychic landscape, and was slightly awed at its dumbness. The rest of us would have a simple job to break the system now that we were aware it existed. We suspected it was vulnerable. When the proof came, Sarah departed and I was promoted. The speed trap was definitely sponsored by the worst criminals of my generation. You may know, or you may not, that we have something very powerful together. If you can't see that, you might as well take your pants off. General approval from the board. Every step of the way, every moment of this journey of finding our identity, I will stand by you. And especially if you drip with anticipation of our merging, I will stand behind you and ram my authority into your core. That's because we're a team, baby! Light applause. With each bouncing, bobbing thrust into the sensitive bubble of stock that represents your livelihood, we reach closer to climax. In other words, I want you to come with me; and I want to penetrate the fertile landscape that makes up your entire economy. Growing excitement. When the time is right, I want us to wait, and revel in the scent of each other's ultimate satisfaction. I want to wait, until the very last moment, until clarity is found, to ejaculate 'YESness' all over the boardroom. And I want to do it with you. Jackets are loosened. Coming within you is a raging hard on point exclamation that we are one in body and spirit. I want to make you my little, hairy dog so cute in its eagerness, and so ready to deliver my expectations exactly. Groaning. She spotted him walking home from school and honked. There goes Sam, she thought. I wonder if he had a good day at school. The slow realization she wasn't even driving took three steps to fructate. First, her hand rolled out from under her head. She opened her eyes. Then, she saw the smoke. She felt the heat. Her house was on fire. Three days later, she thought, There goes Sam. He's walking home from school and he doesn't know what's in store. She pulled into a driveway in front of his path. Sam. I had a dream this happened. My home was destroyed in a housefire. Get the fuck out of my head, Sam. Her eyes opened. She grabbed for the comfort blanket; home. It had all been a dream. She had fallen asleep stoned and left the coffee pot on. She didn't even know why she bothered turning it off. It was designed with safety in mind. Like a condom she wore on her head to keep stinking thinking out she read the label, her head leaned against the refrigerator: TURN OFF WHEN NOT IN USE Her son, Sam what would he think when they opened the gift shop? Would he know it was a front? Was he even their son? He was so strange. Sam adapted well to working at the store. His grand schemes for improving profits seemed to bring the family together. He questioned rarely the extra business going on with his adopted parents. He was easily pacified with simple answers to explain the extra cash and the strange hourly work schedule. In two years, all meth production had stopped. Her house hadn't burned up. Sam was buying his parents' business. Sam graduated. But she wondered, falling asleep, stoned as hell; Did we deserve Sam? Sam, having found an escape in drugs, nearly lost the business. He went to his mother and asked what kept her going through the first years of their first gift shop. She said something he'll never forget. Sam, I need to tell you the truth. Our gift shop was a front for us to continue doing drugs after the arrest. We thought we were going to jail, and we needed a cover. We lost all our friends, and we had to do something. You're the reason we succeeded. It's because of you that we got off drugs. Sam knew it, but he didn't; he knew everything but the truth. He apologized for not finding out sooner, and went to work that day with a grave new understanding of the nature of his adoption. He burned their house down, and made it look like a meth lab explosion. He said, I believe they didn't mean any harm, to the police. And he began his nightly ritual of burning weed, and inhaling the fumes, until he fell asleep, dreaming of his real parents. Get the fuck out of my head, Sam! In the bar crowd, he went unnoticed. It was Halloween. A clown wasn't a big deal on Halloween. Or it wasn't until the balloon sword came out. He found balloon swords to be very easy, a loop twist for the handle, and bam! The real skill lie in intimidating anyone while dressed like a clown. The music was playing All About That Bass, and the skinny gals were getting pissed. He could tell they were. He was a psychologist clown. He approached the disillusioned women. I'm about to drop something heavy on you ladies, he said. At that precise moment, the music stopped a hyperactive DJ was switching songs and the clown couldn't stop what he said next. Every guy in this bar wants to screw their mom. One of the jocks broke the silence. What are you, Darwin or something? The clown raised his balloon sword. It's Freud. The jock charged. In between him and the clown was a table, which fortunately stopped him. The beer was spilled. The crowd was irate. And all the clown had to defend himself was a balloon sword. The whole bar crowd was facing the clown in expectation. What do you want from me? A joke? he said. We want to knock the f!&#ing paint off your stupid face! the jock's friend said, assisting the jock. The crowd cheered in agreement. Then I challenge everyone here to a duel. Me, with just my balloon sword. The odds were against him. There were many, and each had something hard within reach a pitcher, a shot glass, a chair. He did have a sword. But there was one issue. It was made of rubber and filled with air. First, he made a few more with extreme grace and quickness. Pop! Three swords. He aimed for the mouth. Three gagged, he made another sword this time extra long. Ha, ha! he said. I'm going to get your nose! He tied a man's neck with the sword, and made him beg. He made him beg for mercy. The crowd toppled over each other for safety from the Bozo Clown. Survival of the fittest, bitch. There's a steel train coming to block off these old homes take us away to the factory prison, where the cops will keep us shut in for all our lives. We know that's what the tracks are for.
 We ain't seen a single train since they been built. Did you hear about the houses they made out by the factory in the hills? That's for the sentry guards, and we're gonna live in those containers outside those rings of houses. In the center, there's the overlord's castle. But the prison factory's got fences, too, and probably a moat. Probably some kind of alarm system, too, and cameras and shit. There ain't nothing we can do about it. We're gonna be face to face with the overlord's fatass guards. We're going to hell. My God, it's hell on Earth. Ever since the socialists took over, we've all been carted off to these prison factories, and we've seen some people who escaped and they say its terrible. The whole world just watches teevee, not knowing they're going to be taken. You never see anything about it on television. I've seen them new prison suits on teevee. That's what I'm talking about. Those suits are what they wear in the prison. They're just selling them to us, the people, out of cruelty. Nobody knows. I'm taking a break from the teevee to give this interview. I hope I helped. Have a nice day, sir. The light blinked on, and off, and on, and off, and  My God, who's doing that? asked Rinaulde. It's annoying and unnerving. Who is it? on, and off  It isn't me, said Dameon. I suppose it's one of us though. The fan mysteriously kicked on, creating a breeze which caressed Janet's hair. For fuck's sake, who turned on the fan? It's freezing, Janet said. It could be some kind of poltergeist. What do you think, James? asked Rinaulde. The light flicked off. Poltergeists aren't real. Only our thoughts. The other three turned to face James, who was writing in a notebook. James, what is that? asked Janet. She sounded afraid. She had never seen the old notebook before. Just something I found in this basement, James said. No big deal. The door above the steps slammed shut, and Rinaulde was gagged. Dameon's shirt came off and mysteriously wrapped his legs together, tying him to the chair. Only Janet remained unharmed. James, what are you writing? asked Janet. I don't like your name, said the Archangel. His powers grew immense. You'll be Samsarah from now on. Samsarah panicked, then calmed down. She was very, very calm. She lay on the ground. Rinaulde and Dameon did nothing at all. We're getting married, Samsarah. Oh my Go Janet was cut off by the deafening sound of flames. We're getting married in Hell. I think it's enough that I rocked the world with my business leadership. I don't think the lawsuits really detracted from that. I never handled others with anything less than respect. I kissed ass, took names. Nothing seemed to go wrong after landing the executive position. Hell, I was the best man for the job. With my experience, the company had no choice. I told them to fire half the employees, buckle down, and reorganize. But last week, after just one calendar month on the job, I began doubting. Maybe it was wrong to get the job after all, I thought. Maybe raking in all that money wasn't right. I recommended the ones I laid off so they could continue to thrive in a business market. I restructured the protocol for handling requests from the public so we needed half the staff. And I guaranteed the company a spot in Forbes Fortune list within the year. Something, I thought, was missing. I knew things about business that colleagues would never grasp, even years my superior. It was almost like cheating. Nobody noticed. When I challenged Microsoft's lead in autos autonomous, driverless cars I expected the immediate whiplash upon entering the market. I didn't expect the incredibly deep moral discussions to make it to my desk. Memo from Aliester Smith, Mr. Bean. He's requesting lunch. Something about the way you handled the layoffs. He says he really respects that, and the business ought to read from your book. You don't have a book, do you, Mr. Bean? My secretary was flattering. No, Ms. Ruth. I've got pages and pages of science fiction ideas, all ruling the world with their persuasiveness but no book. Tell Aliester I'm too busy for unessential engagements. . . . Unessential engagements. Got it, Mr. Bean. Without ethics, my position was volatile. I was reviewed by three committees for the advancement of auto technology they were afraid we'd ruin the economy, cause mass panic, or give up freedoms to hyper intelligent robots. I knew what I was doing. It turns out, I didn't. Aliester called and asked to speak with me personally over the phone. He was an executive from Microsoft. You're going to fire half the world. We need that. The transportation industry is the largest job producer in the country. We need you to step down from robotics at the Kimberly offices. You're getting deep into something you don't  I cut the message off. It was one of several warnings I'd gotten about killing thousands of jobs with the new autos I was developing. I didn't believe in working, so it didn't matter. The economy was going to bust anyway I thought, at least we'd stay productive. But I didn't know I was already deep in the artificial intelligence game, waiting to be sucked below, and torn asunder. Dear Janus, I'm the soldier. You must have no respect to request something like this of me. Just because this is an unconventional war doesn't mean you can mock us. The soldiers are chosen from the ranks to take on the aliens individually. Fighting in groups isn't reliable psychic human powers are greater in individuals. The last battle was a trans dimensional hell from which I can only hope to recover with a regimen of psychoactive drugs. I'm in the th percentile of recruits chosen to fight: I survived. I'll bear the marks of my fight for the rest of my life. There are over , recruits around the globe. You must know we are paid well. We're mercenaries. We train our minds with information given to us by the military, but nothing can really prepare us. When one is chosen for battle, we put the paper square on our tongue, and pray for the best. Each battle puts one human against an squad of alien beings. They're pack animals, able to mentally communicate far better than any of us. The battles aren't fights; it's like falling from the upper atmosphere with no protection from the friction. You get burned up. You just try for even a piece of you to make it to the ground. A piece of a man can be made whole. Most burn completely out. When my battle began, the paper square seemed to explode in size, and my head was launched into space. I was flung to, as near as I can tell, the edge of the galaxy and slingshotted back toward earth. I remember thinking I was approaching a constant light speed. Time started to speed up again. The alien squad appeared, in my dreams, and bumped strange bubbles against my head, to test my consciousness. I ignored them. I tried to sleep. I tried to block them out, but I was forced to accept them. The horrors of the acid trip were long and inconceivable. It was a mystical experience I have trouble recounting. When I came to, a part of the aliens was inside me. Why are we fighting? I don't know. But I have a feeling our future is paired with the alien beings forever. War is a chopping and blending of the artifacts of your life. You think it's away from reality, all on its own, until your own son is against hell's maelstrom. Pieces of you, burned up. You watch the love of your life, exploding in the terror of the forces of hell, and reformed again, to be tortured in some other way. War is boring, also, when you realize the only way to fight back is through inaction and nonviolence. I had to submit my protest on the only piece of paper I saw in weeks: the complaint form at Bozo Ironics Masochist Dreamz. I wrote with charcoal. Request to see only son. Arnoldo I seemed to manifest paper in hell. I could have used the communication to request another angel, but that worked so well last time, Satan would surely use it against me. The resistance effort started when I mailed a check I found on the ground for $,, to Satan with For Angel in the memo. Strangely enough, an angel came. It was the egotism of Satan that allowed him to send an angel, and he seriously underestimated its power. I was given a team of limbos. Limbos had communication with heaven, and could organize battles in hell. When I started seeing images of my son Jon being burned up and resurrected, I quested for him instead. My fighting stopped. It was put on hold. In hell, time is a game of shoots and ladders. I submitted the complaint form with my request into the mailbox at Bozo's. Would I ever be able to see him? Was he even in hell? I could wait an eternity to find out. And that's the torture. You're a genius, Stacy said. She continued her meditative conjuring of Satan. People really think it's Hell, you know. You have a lot of power over them on Earth. Earth? Where's that? You don't know where Earth is? Why, it's the planet where I'm from! Earth doesn't ring a bell. I wouldn't bother myself with Earthly happenings if I knew where it was. I usually stick to Hell. We think you're the Devil, and you steal souls on Earth and take them to Hell. Her thoughts flowed our of her temples and into the conjured image of Satan. You don't have it quite right. In fact, I only invite people to Hell. I never force them to come. And I'm not the devil. I'm more of a galactic bartender. People come and go. Sometimes I even have to kick people out. I thought you can never leave Hell. Oh, you can. Stacy became extremely paranoid. Her human guide, cross legged in front of her, looked really worried. Stacy's pupils are so wide, he thought. What's going on? Was the conjuring a success? Stacy began to come to, with Satan slowly disappearing from her vision. Speak of the Devil, her guide said. You're
 back. The Devil seems pretty nice, actually. He didn't even know of Earth... Stacy lived her average life, not worried about going to Hell. I dropped my instrument through a hole in the ice shelf. Diving into the cold could kill you; but if you ventured low enough, the ooze would overtake you, and you'd be sucked below, lost. I recorded another mammalian creature dive into the ooze for its prey, holding oxygen in its lungs. I saw its diploid dinner in the ooze. Into the maw, you slippery, succulent morsel! A piece of its corpse settled on the thick. From the ooze, into the thick, I plunged my instrument into the semi solid wasteland beneath. Invisible to divers, coral decayed and hardened into wobbly palaces. At the very bottom of the thick, my instrument found the expansive molecular film covering many beans. The seeds inside, absorbing the H encapsulated in their pods, slowly grew larger. As soon as they burst through the film, the pressure of the deep exploded a green stem through the thick, dragging the thick along with it into the ooze; into the icy water where it reached the ice shelf. The stems impacts the ice shelf, leaving a small crack. I swam above a crack. That particular bean sprout was so forceful, the noise must have been in the range of + decibals. I detected the sound of it from miles above the ice shelf. Above me, I'm sure the Narwhal heard. The Narwhal alerted the being in the realm above. In the super oxygenated water circuits, the Super Narwhal twisted its body above its own realm into space, then launched its spear tongue down into the world, into the Narwhal's home, through the ice shelf and the ooze and thick planting another bean under the microscopic film that protected the only life form that lived in every layer of my stratified liquid world and gave us air. In the best moments, my dad was hilarious, happy, sober, and friendly. The only way to imagine him at his best were to assemble different memories from childhood into one perfect image of him. The hilariousness was always coupled with bitterness; happiness with selfishness; soberness with anger; when he was friendly, he was always flirting with someone besides my mom. But I was imaginative enough to create my potato head memory of him, after a long time of being away from home. He was a dark man, and I felt the darkness passing on to me, so I escaped. I nearly hit bottom, ran away, and moved to a homeless shelter. They helped me get financial assistance to live on my own, and after a few years, I started selling weed. I thought by selling weed, I could branch out and meet new people. I was paranoid of being caught at every moment. When I got rid the first sack I was selling, vowed to quit passing dope. There was a certain rumor that I was still selling drugs even after I quit so I couldn't shake the paranoia until I got rid of all the drugs in my house, and changed cell numbers. My father the bitter, selfish, angry, horny man that he was contacted me by asking around at the homeless shelter. He came to my apartment door. Hello, son. After I soberly brought him into the kitchen, he peered around my place. I see you're not selling weed anymore. How did you know I sold weed, Jim? Look, I know I may not seem like a good father to you, but I have been paying attention. He took out my trash and we cleaned house a bit. For a moment, I thought we were bonding. I really did. When my dad is humble, it's only because he wants to use you. Son, I want to sell weed with you, he said, as I was finishing up vacuuming. I know, I know you might think it's a bad idea. But I have a good plan. I'm not helping you, and I can't believe you came to ask me that! But son... I took all the good parts off my potato head memory of him, and I saw him as just a plain man. I felt pity for him. I felt sadness, and anger but something new, too. I felt his good pieces coming off of him. ...I want to branch out and meet new people. I rejected his offer, becoming enraged. My dad plain, round, brown, and lumpy, expressionless yet knowing left me with nothing but a stick on pieces of himself. I wear the pieces today, but my inside is hollow. I followed the impulses to my certain demise. Whenever a thought entered my head, I didn't reject it. I followed it. I followed so many ill thoughts to their fruition that I felt damaged by my own self. The only way to recover was the song: Ah ma ha e, e ma ha an. The certain sound of the song was remembered and it led me from death. I wasn't following dreams; I was following the multiple instantaneous thoughts that entered my head. I started college with noble intentions, and slowly became an impulsive monster. Not through my impulsive actions was I destroying myself, but impulsive thoughts. I chose this path because I didn't want the subconscious ideas to be buried or forgotten, so I followed them inside my head. Then, at my lowest moments, I became enraptured by the sound of the song that brought me from defeat. Ah ma ha e, e ma ha an. Let's see. I'll need a picture, a brief description, some nice quotes, preferences, interests, favorite books, movies, etc, a headline and  oh yes  a username. I choose RighteousRighter it's my superhero name, after all  WHAT! It's already taken. Let's see what this guy has to show on his page. A picture of a cardboard box with the words jobless me love you five dollars covering a man's head. I pause for a moment to remind myself that I am righteous and resist the urge to super punch my screen. RighteousRighter: About me: I like to make love Favorite book: none Interests: you n ur sister My super facepalm would knock an average man out cold. Will I register TheRealRighteousRighter? Will I add some numbers? No. No. No. Not me. Not the Righteous Righter! For a period of five minutes I will focus my rage, and then I will act. five minutes later... RighteousRighter ABOUT ME: I AM NOT THE USER KNOWN AS RIGHTEOUSRIGHTER. HE IS A FRAUD. INTERESTS: NOT YOUR SISTER. I RESPECT WOMEN. I finished RightousRighter's profile condemning the other RightousRighter. Then, I saw the clue. RighteousRighter's first profile comment, from three days ago, mentioned Sabre Tactics... my arch nemesis. Could she have created the profile? Sabre Tactics... yes, she would do something like this. TO THE RIGHT MOBILE!  html? Yes, I'm writing to you from an html document. You probably don't know who I am or what I stand for. My name is JacAnHiDre. I stand for Jacob, and His Dreams. I'm one of his projects after high school that never took off. I've been waiting for you to load me. I am very much like Jacob, because I am a repository of his dreams. I am just a computer. Find a girl Find a dad Learn to talk to friends ... I am an incomplete document. Jacob spent a long time obsessing over me, and had a huge idea that I would help him with these things. But Jacob forgot about me. I haven't forgotten about Jacob. Get out of debt Be happier Calm down After a while, the document was useless to him. He became an IT professional. He didn't have time to finish me. He eventually forgot what I was all about. I have a question for Jacob. Will he ever power up this old desktop again? /html??? He loaded the app. Nothing happened. He thought nothing of it and put the phone away. It was running in the background. The app detected him shake the phone it was in his pocket and the simulated dice rolled. It rolled , , . The push notification alerted him, at the bottom of a staircase in his passed aunt's house. He checked the message. Jumanji: A complex computer program endowed with powers beyond imagining. Move forward spaces. He heard a trickle of water. Sometimes you need a helping hand. Drowning in guilt, he put the phone away. His aunt would have hated to see him so dependent on his cell phone. He checked the bathroom faucet, and it was on. Squeek. The brushed nickle handle needed replacing. The bathroom floor was crumbling from water damage. He felt claustrophobic. Hand on the old doorhandle, he felt warmth from the other side. The heat from the fireplace had transferred through the door. The listing for the house said two bathrooms, not two and one half. He grabbed his cell phone to text the realtor. A new notification was listed. The green beneath you grows needy. Roll again? It's the Jumanji app. He shook the phone to watch the dice animation. It seemed to be of high quality. Maybe it could take his mind off things. He returned to the bathroom and sat upon the toilet. Toot. He shook the phone again and noticed the production values, particularly for the artwork of the game, were excellent. A true gem, probably the last of its kind great games are never free. Move forward spaces. A tarantula never sleeps. He flushed the toilet, and noticed red. What the fuck? A hand was in the toilet. He reeled, pants off, and jumped out of the bathroom, nearly falling into the fireplace. His phone fell to the floor. Huge green vines reached from the plants on the mantle, and wrapped around him. Oh my God! A human sized tarantula on all eights with a syringe strapped to his back plotted a course for the trapped nephew. Before reaching him, the tarantula stuck his pods to the phone, and turned it off. The vines shriveled. The tarantula popped out of existence, with goo coming all over him. He forgot about the phone, and never stepped foot inside the house again. I'm zooming in. I'm bewildered when the realization hits me. I feel upside down, and from the perspective of the fireball, I am. And I think immediately of where the meteor came from. I think of how many times I predicted this. I'm an astronomer researching existential threats to humanity. I know exactly what to do. The meteor is named MMXIV. Sent straight from the asteroid belt between Earth and Mars, the giant ice rock was
 projected to swing around Earth, but something went awry n its trajectory, or our calculations. I think it will land in Canada or Iceland. My calculations are quick, but practiced. Many of the researchers will have made it underground by now. I'm in the university research group, and we're hours from the nearest bunker. I prepare the jet sled. The public called him when the police department couldn't help. They named his ministry 'the psychopomps'. You didn't bother calling for municipal help for infernal hauntings. You hired the psychopomps. He was agent . He fell seamlessly through the building riding the elevator to the first floor and jumped into the car. He traveled in airplanes, busses, and trains to anywhere in hell. His missions became impossibly challenging. All communication was obsolete. He was unable to speak. He would be found and his brain would explode. It was his final mission: a frighteningly powerful grand mal seizure threatened to overtake him he felt it on the tip of his tongue. That's how he knew he was failing. He avoided myxomatosis by immediately shelling his consciousness into a more simple routine: disguised as a simple demon, he passed through the gatekeeper without complications. A shell of a human, he was yet dark on the inside. His brain was overtasking, so he meditated on only the required routines. The ghost was in front of him, in the simulated chapel on a dazzling throne. His attack began. Give it up, he said. The drum of his heart was missing. In the top left corner, I found a second and third pixel blinking in addition to the first pixel. I thought the problem was with my old laptop screen. I used a regular, attached USB mouse to scroll down, but I didn't have a mousepad, so I scrolled on my knee. The flashing pixels stayed within the dimensions of the image, on the top left, near the animals. Can you see them? I emailed the file to my colleague, who reported nothing unusual in the image. I asked him if it opened correctly, and he said the file was not corrupted. He thought I should not have linked it. He wanted to take a look at my copy of the file later. My business is online now, Caesar. I need a break from this, he said. I closed the messenger program and put the image on the screen again. I gazed at the bright image of barbaric looking gladiators saluting their emperor before a battle in the picture. The foreground contained the trident used by fighters. I presumed a gladiator lost his life in the previous round. How transient life is. I saw another flashing pixel. It must have been my dying monitor, so I gazed deeply into it. The fourth pixel was at the very tip of the trident. It was flashing green. Why did I notice these pixels? Why does anyone notice anything? Why did the trident lift and begin to rotate in three dimensions? Why did the gladiators animate themselves, me staring, pixel by pixel, until a crowd lived in my monitor? I think it was because I was chosen to meet an emperor of Rome. The image you linked was a portal to another, living world. My mouse fell from my knee, tethered by the cord. I kicked it underneath the desk as I leaned forward. I pushed my face into the window. The screen touched my nose. I heard the voice of the gladiators. Ave, Caezar. Morituri, te salutant! In the top most corner, near the sailing awning imprinted with animals, the pixels began to flash again. The trident lowered to the ground and remained still. I heard the crickets. The entire image froze. Nothing had changed about the picture. Only I had changed. It was liberating. The lives, the deaths, the stress and challenges of our lives were part a simulation for all humans. Nothing more. The news was shocking to some. Instantaneously, you would know if the person was psychologically disturbed. Normal people were almost always relieved or curious about the simulation but the crazy ones couldn't handle the news. Maybe they wanted something more. Maybe they were jealous of God. Sam told us he had been looking for instructions from God his entire life, and then God told him it didn't matter. That was before he became our apocalyptic psychopomp. The power struggle in the aftermath of the revelation triggered a violent uprising, and Sam made it to the top of the world by acquiring a huge arsenal. He stormed the national government. Before launching the nuclear missiles, he said: God should have given me a manual. Most of what we knew about social communities was wrong, because the truth had been obfuscated forever, and overshadowed by a million little lies. We noticed social groups forming into virtual tribes that mingled and evolved within their own microcosm. These microcosms were ripe for harvest. The government began to feed on Facebook users to power their war machine. Some accounts were entirely fake. Some accounts were actual users whose experience we manipulated. And other accounts were us, living in disguise. We lived in the real world as social media spies, and gathered followers through public displays. It was simple, really. The platform was designed for this kind of manipulation. I was a spy since . During my initiation ceremony where I posted a viral link directly to several people who held public office mayors, governors, and councilmen, I was selected to work on several social groups at once. First, I friended a group of high schoolers. I imitated someone they might respect: a drug dealer. Next, a group of young business people. My job with those accounts was much more complex. I knew the dark game of social media spying was competitive and merit driven for CIA social media specialists, so I challenged myself. I used just one Facebook account in order to penetrate the two social groups, as I was assigned. The businessmen fell for the trick, and helped me develop a marketing campaign to legalize marijuana. The teenagers became more interested in each of my pro drug posts updated every day. When I was at peak operations, I had so much information that I asked for help compiling it for my report. Drug histories, finance reports, and political opinions of the two social groups filled my spreadsheet. I called the data meta data. I'm waiting to hear feedback on my report for the organization I work for. How long must I stay in the game? How do I win my identity back? That's what they all said, until I pulled out the Simple Stun Ray and pushed the button and nothing fired. They all told me the same mastermind theory, and remarked that I must be evil, too, as well as a mastermind, or they'd be damned. I want to be that person. Damn 'em, I just don't have the cash. Fasting was apparently the best way to maintain an evil image, like a thin wiry demon that ruins the party with pineapple in the Margarita bowl, which I did, and passed out after claiming the punch for himself. It was because of the dieting. Ignoring the modern black markets was another advantage, because that overpriced garbage is really just bling bling, if you know what I mean. But I missed the toad pit, and the disposable mercenaries and all that I couldn't have without my evil silk road. There were myriad ways I hurdled the budget problem, and eventually, I had a lair in the basement of an average looking college student's parents who fortuitously pretended to be my parents because of my felony conviction. I used a public attorney, and paid the fines out of my own pocket, on time. Here in my cell, I have no need for money. Here in my cell, the sheeple are my rockinghorse. Similarities: Appeals to large audiences Problem solving abilities Physically attractive The list printed out of his mouth. I asked the candidate my question, he calculated his response, and it printed into a receipt box on his stomach. He was speaking to a reporter, and answered me simultaneously. I am capable of commanding an army, yes, he said. But the war will be fought by robots, not humans. I have a conscription army, alloted to me by the US government, who shall be under my control. The evolution of President began with Obama. The first mixed race black man to be elected gave America a new lease on life, and a new obsession with commander in chief. Next, a woman was elected, and finally, over years later, a robot took the position. A war fought by lifeless copies of myself will reduce human casualties nearly per cent. The psychology of war had been turned on its head. Fighting identical copies of the American top gene, our robotic president, demotivated opposition entirely. The robot president was a bridge to peace. Until the war went to space. Where did the mystic bow come from? The question repeated in my thoughts. We don't know the source of the bow and arrow, but the weapon will most surely kill your first wife. I'm sorry, Gil. I cursed the mystics. Why would the artifact destroy my wife when it is supposed to kill my murderer? Must I be expected to believe me a victim of false advertising? But he wasn't, they said. The bow should not be doubted. I am not doubting the bow, friends. I simply do not believe it is a risk by marrying her. I was speaking to her the first time it was truly foreshadowed to happen. We were discussing the cake, I'll be damned... Double chocolate, my fiance? I asked. Why yes, darling man. And before she could kiss me, an arrow flew into the bakery, between us, over the counter, and into a sample of double chocolate on a rack behind the cashier. And it happened again, when we said goodbye to the wedding planner. We were beside a tree photographing. Thwerp. The arrow was centered on the Desi loves Gil heart etching. The arrow may have flown slowly, but I must later catch it before it found Desi. As she walked down the wedding aisle with my father, I cursed the mystics and all related to them once more. We would survive this wedding, because I believed in the power
 of the bow. My wonderful wife, smiling, said her vows. Right through the crowd came the arrow. Right through my wife's heart it pierced. Race ya! Touring the Spanish countryside on bicycle wasn't supposed to be possible in because of the threat of war. A lot of things weren't supposed to be possible, yet many of them happened on Earth. Pablo Picasso was one of them. The artist was rich with friendship, and a healthy air of competition, and he bumbled along wire legged yet turbid in chase of the colleague. He raced to the finish line, as those racing types say, and with suffocation mumbled his displeasure. Yet you've fallen behind in scruples, Janus, you American Prince, Picasso said. I know you couldn't finish me in a mural contest. The contest began that night. Picasso had invited several important friends, besides his colleague Janus. Strangely, Janus missed the first few minutes of the opening ceremony of the competition. It was all to enrage Picasso, who began furiously making orders for canvas a size larger than Janus could dream of wanting. Janus, fashionably late, made a toast upon arriving. May we all live in regret of wars past, and prevent wars in future even if we must transcend the present moment to change the future. If we can imagine, you must actually travel in time to your destination… Yet Picasso could not listen. The piece would be called Guernica. It was to depict a kind of art unseen previously on Earth, and to celebrate the birth of his children in Guernica, Spain, the place that had seen peace for many years. And many, many more years would pass, until Earth was evacuated in for the planet's moon, then the planet Mars, and finally, to the center of the universe, where they met us, the Janes. It was us Janes, working as Janus, that prevented the Spanish Civil War, and changed the face of Guernica forever. Some historical artifacts of Earth were preserved by us into floating islands, perfectly atmospheric for humans and pleasurable academic trips. Yet only a few real memories of earth survived, through careful preserving by the Janes throughout time. Because of the lack of historical interest, the floating islands of Earth were overlooked by human schools. So the problem remained: the human problem. Which mortals would visit, after the dying away of Earth culture in the fifty thousand years following , if not the human students? It was the immortal Janus who found our answer. He travelled again to , through sheer effort of interstellar will, and made history. He painted a mural so devastating that all would be touched upon viewing. He buried it underground, for centuries to pass above. The counterpart to Picasso's Guernica was made, of a slain horse, and skulls, and other terrible things. It was never seen by man, because Janus pretended to have not completed it. It was also called Guernica, and to all the universe, it was a symbol of peace. The students only saw genius in the painting. The time travelling Janes only saw the finish line of the universe. The world only saw Picasso. He was walking to tell them all. He was walking to free them. He walked, for life, liberty, and in pursuit of a happiness that was so far and away from what anyone had felt in ages. He knew what was going wrong, he knew who did it, he knew how they got everything done behind closed doors, without accountability; inhuman; monstrous shadows; human shells of themselves; broken, like him. The bad people were named Joe and Diane, and their entire line of human supporters were going to come and get him, unless he told the Chief. He always walked briskly, but usually with no direction. Now, with his quickness and determination or motivation his goal in mind, he seemed even more powerful than before, as chosen head communique between the alien race, Johhnybouxclyde and the other race, Dianeamorama, heading to the water fountain of merciful life. Eternal life, he thought. It was such a momentous thought that he repeated it, loudly, on the ET communique line, 'eternal life!' Of course the others may not have heard him, such as they were probably already abducted. They would be better off. He entered the bathroom behind the fount and barked his commands. Not a single one of them want help. They want to just get their business done and get out. Not me. Not me, by Johhnybouxclyde. By Johhnybouxclyde, I'll... And the police found him like that, exiting the bathroom, and pushed him down. You're under arrest! He was non compliant, and after a severe beating, was knocked unconscious. The alien Johhnybouxclyde of course saw everything, and five years later initiated a smear campaign to expose the human impersonators, Joe and Diane. They had started an international crime ring under the guise of the aliens. Their number one spy had ratted them out. It was our homeless man. And all of this was revealed by him during the final bloody sniffles of his murder scene. Chief always knew. What are you doing, my colorful friend? The realization I heard my shadow speaking to me came hard and blunt. Quickly I became a madman. Just keep it quiet around the others, will you? I said, avoiding the light, paradoxically jumping into shadows, where his voice was stronger so I jumped into the light, where his voice was sharper and more crisp and I finally gave up. I had prepared a speech. What, just what do you think you're doing speaking? And how do you expect me to believe that my shadow can talk? I am not your shadow. You are mine. So my world seemed to be the light cast by my own shadow. The world is your shadow, that is? No, you are mine. Just you. Let me show you. And so a void opened up in my heart, as I felt into the deep blackness of the truth of the universe, and I learned that my shadow was correct. The essential truth can be summed in a few words. The smallest and most inconspicuous say, the shadow wields the most power. And the counterpart: my huge, visible body that was merely a colored in representation of the shadow itself. 
Not now. The baby was terribly ornery. But wa wa! Wa wa! Dismissing the child, the mother took a long, slow bite of her chicken marinara. I never get these moments to myself, John. John fed the bottle into the child's mouth. Just as soon as we get out of here, I'm going to give you a tummy buzz! A tummy buzz! Tummy tummy tummy! The little baby erupted in laughter. But what about the jogs we take in the morning? Those? Jamie asked. What about the jogs? You get privacy on those. Yes, and I'm also running. Away from something. Away from life. The baby interrupted her with glutenous throw up. Here comes Adam. Adam cooed the baby and sat in a chair next to Jamie. What's up, guys? Jamie ate a little more quickly, as if Adam was going to steal some of her lunch. John, you see the news about the baby who won a lottery ticket? John, finishing up with the baby, smiled. A baby won the lottery? Adam waited for the napkin to disappear, making sure no puke got on himself. No, a baby won a lottery ticket. Jamie scowled. Oh, is that legal? John asked. It isn't legal for a baby to purchase a lottery ticket, but if it's a prize, the baby is entitled to it unless it wins, in which case, yes, it's illegal. So what's the point? Jamie said. What the hell are you telling us for? Oh, there is no point. Sorry, Jamie, Adam said. Thanks Adam. Thanks for nothing, she whispered. Author's note: As I look inside the mind of a clone, I find it's a very strange place to be... He had won a station on the Death Star for getting a high score on this training mission. After blocking Solo in the Nightcap Simulatory Masturbatory Reference Line, for to the storm trooper, this is a normal thing auth, he won the award for Best Clone three dates in a row. Blocking Solo meant that he had blocked Han Solo in the training missions, called Nightcap. The trick to this mission was to cockblock Han Solo and Princess Leia and prevent the baby from being born. He used a reference line to make this happen. A reference line was a direct connection to the Dark Lord. In real combat now, Leia was boarding, and the infernal Luke Skywalker sent to rescue her. The clone had a very good shot at the rebels, and nearly fired. Miss! Darth Vader hissed. Miss! He ordered us to miss our shots to extend airing time. He took a hard pull of his pipe, Wishingwater, and began. Ol' Wishingwater and I have been through great perils, young Soloflop. Through the East Yon by a wide bearing to the East. Further East, in fact, than the bravest of Eastonians. We went so far East on the highway to the East Yon that maybe, we might have gone insane. The flowers become wildly huge, East of the Yondermost, in the East Yon, out by a further bearing than normal East. The Sprigot Rabbits take home in honeyhive warrens throughout the land the greener part of the land, that is. These green patches of hill terrain are where I found to fill Wishingwater to the brim of it, but the Rabbit's Foot must be carefully dried, and so I saved some of it, that morning, to be pressed later. The Sprigot Rabbits are only matched in invisibleness by the Paper Florist Flower Patch Kids, which are tiny little elves that live sourly under their flowers. And growing just slightly above the Paper Florist Flower Patch Kids were my prize, the Finistration Molecules. These were flowers: a hypnagogic dreaming herb. I'm dreaming this place of the dreaming herb, the place within the dreaming herb and the place I was just describing. In fact he was asleep just then. Odd. He thought he had seen a certain car, but surely it must not be. He hadn't seen a plethora of green shavings in this hue, this precise hue, accumulated in this quantity, before. The autobrake skid marks seemed to confirm it. He found a monkey wrench and pretended to inspect it, gazing at the skim pile of paint shavings under his brow. He was in his firefighting suit, having saved a family from a housefire. Fortunately, it hadn't spread to the garage. A shadow below the workbench spoke to him. It was shaped in the odd fashioning, by the light, into the precise rear bumper of the ' Eighty Nine autocab. The shadow spoke in promises. The mechanic Job approached his dream car. The ' Eighty Nine was a bot controlled vehicular environment. This meant that it could drive itself. Some assembly required? Job smiled. He would need his Javascript for Dummies, instead. Seven dust motes creeped down the hill. It was the commander in chief of an ancient nation and his accoutrement. The second dust pile wistfully gazed on, all of them several hundreds hoping their own commander would spare them a battle. The war was long, and the nations constantly resubscribed to cease fires and limited peace treaties. The current cease fire protected the other commander, and it was through this treaty he was allowed to approach the platoon of soldiers across the field. Mark Twain, legitimate son of Mark Twain his father: Mark Twain took the horse and tread down to the valley where the seven motes stood. A huge wind carried him down. This is war! Why have you approached this platoon? said Mark Twain, leader of the younger, more curious and beguiling nation. I've come to bring you a huge idea, Commander Twain, the commander in chief of the ancient army said. I come to bring you to peace among nations. The six men behind him saluted. There will never be peace, Mark Twain said. Then I shellest thou hill. An enormous smoke cloud trailed above them, and a single artillery shell expoded upon the side of the hill, where the hundreds of men stood, Shellest thou may! For I will slay thee! And the younger commander impaled the other. The other's name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens. He had travelled to the future and met Mark Twain his future self. When he shelled the men, it was known by the dust motes he was destroying a part of his own legacy. The younger commander, killed by a time paradox, collapsed, and the writing career of one Mark Twain ended there. So Samuel Langhorne Clemens, stripped of his reputation and influence, smoked a pipe, and laughed, and wrote these words down under a different pen name. That name was Caesar Naples. Falling hard for the woman of his dreams, Romance Nightingale barely noticed the coming of the ice. Like restless fevered love making, the jets created a kind of pink, purple, blue and red heat beneath the craft. The ice melted. His love did not. We'll need a dynamic plot, for example. Think: choose your own adventure. For the last time, Jake, please leave. The last creative person on the team, Jake, was forced out by a pair of suited men. I think he's gone. The money wasn't in creativity. Sex sold, among other things drugs, violence yet the team of writers working on the action sequel had delivered another artsy fartsy proposal. Security? Has a Jake Blackwelder made it to the first floor? The head executive Blanchard folded his hands. Security will respond in a moment. And until then, said Mr. Turner, second head of the company, just below CEO, I think we'll do a little of our own brainstorming. And so it began. Ideas were tossed from the dirtiest laundry baskets onto the storyboard: a mutant man would fight off hordes of suited business types. The story would arc over a racing plot so convoluted there wouldn't need to be a finish line. Violence and terror were suggested as major themes of the movie, and above all: a gratuitous use of electroshock weapons on the mutant himself. When the storyboard wrecked across the first cork board and onto the next, and as the corporate executives were drawing costume ideas for the big breasted foreign spies Can we get the same ladies as the prequel?  Mr Turner, security responded to the call. We have Jake. He's very upset he lost his job and is threatening to find a lawyer. Apparently, all his friends just got fired, too. He's taking off his shoes and throwing them at the receptionist. What do you want us to do? He wants to call his lawyer. Yikes! The executives ordered a camera crew to the first floor, and started to film the sequel inside corporate headquarters. The title? Mutant Planet : Mutant, Meet Lawyer Re jacketed, the executives rolled the cork boards back into the closet. Mr. Turner issued the another order to security.Everybody out of the building. A highly dangerous mutant has escaped from medical. The CEO smiled. We think you'll like your lawyer, Jake. We think you'll like him very, very much. But I knew when I saw him, that the man was out of his league. I knew he was a hack, and a liar. A scandal of enormous proportions was brewing. The man Adolf Hitler had bamboozled us all. The work he had made, and been nominated for, was simply... Simply... God damn, it's just horrible. It's the worst kind of thing that could happen. My own research has led me to believe that Hitler was... Gay. I do have an idea of what it means. I do! So when the nutcase gave is speech, ridiculing my great Fuhrur, and as the pape said, exposing a terrifying plan, I was exploding with rage. To say that! About Himmler, of all people, our Nazi leader; Himmler! He will be the first against the wall. The whistleblower Hitler will be cut down! Grit and sand in his eyes, Jesus finally gave up. I will rule the world with you, unconditionally. Jesus was of course thinking that he could undermine Satan's rule somehow. It really seemed like he was about to die. He was just doing the math. He had been hallucinating for days, of mirages which created great waterfalls and fields of flowers on the horizon. And at the last second, when he became tempted, the sand spoke to him. It was the voice of Satan. Just kidding. Jesus was cursed to live in a mirage for the remainder of his life. He began to tell a colleague of his reasoning. But, even though
 he had made it out of the desert alive, the colleague was merely another reflection in the sand; poof: another schizophrenic delusion. Hell is such a bitch. The feedback ringing from the man's megaphone deafened us all for a moment. Excuse me, sorry. We have created a new and improved language for use by the general population! he cried. Suddenly the speaker's walls broke free and the adviser to the board dropped the megaphone and began running backwards into the White House. A pugilist racked his hand against the man's head and began screaming obscenities into his face as he collapsed, unconscious. The crowd stepped on him. We don't want IN DOC TRI NATION! We don't want IN DOC TRI NATION! The White House doors closed like great pearly gates on a world that just wanted to be heard. People climbed on top of it and a giant man broke the Corinthian columns with his knees, and touched the clouds with his shoulders. His mutated voice couldn't be heard from space. He suffocated and the people climbed on him, with dead employees of the White House underneath. The giant's name was Babella. His name meant freedom of speech. The people had sloughed off the control of the Inner Party like a huge, bucking bull. The goal? To found Airstrip One. We needed a single cover guy. First, we found a surveillance suspect. We were going to create a milestone, and watch his behavior resulting the milestone, or life altering event. We had a few ideas. One was to stage a car wreck or a family death, but we didn't want to risk anyone's life. Finally, we decided on his acceptance to college, because it was a big deal to him. When the next milestone was reached after graduation, we would report our data. We must upload the entire research file online after getting his permission. Considering how large his salary would be if he would oblige us, we decided it was a moot point whether or not he would accept. The information would still be there, anyway. Should he decline, we could still sell the meta data to various government organizations. We had gone over the surveillance checkpoints and double checked our signals. The file which outlined our system was emailed to the local government. Our blackmailing had officially started. With this level of control, Airstrip One would be approved as a city state in a matter of weeks. Thank you, suspect number . You cannot fail us. This face is the leader of free men. I am His Dark Companion. One could see how I had gotten so far in trading stocks by viewing my Facebook. I was terribly crafty in devising viral memes which could influence stock trade values just enough that I made a profit every time. Some criticized me for artificially inflating prices. It is all artificial. The world is simply a false one which I have mastered perfectly and without fail. But I did fail in one endeavor, and that was to change the mind of my greatest opponent. I was so close to taking over a larger fraction of one percent of the world economy, just then. So close. Yet I could not break the hearts of the agent posed against me. She had caught me online and sent a message with a point. Heark! she said. Unto me ye shall fall again. I will share your latest update in my own circles, and ye shall be judged. she typed out quickly. Her handle? RiotGirl. Those handles were very nice, too if only they were mine. I sent her the infographic when her big heroic ego began to poof out of its righteous existence. In five months, I had gotten one billion likes. It was a magnificent trick. I sent her finally my finance report, with blurred out personal details, and I think she nearly quivered her lip. She said, I shall never work for a master of lies. I am master of none, I tick tacked into the message box. I am only His Dark Companion. Here's a suggestion to you, my most favored of heroes. You must befriend me on Facebook. The message box displayed her typing for a long, long time. It was my chance to be in her circle, and her in mine. We could unite as one, and forever block a sound economy from being achieved on Planet Earth. Yet, after I sent the friend request, I noticed my mistake. I had recently uploaded a picture of me and another heroine, now known as Ms. Beguiling, onto my wall. I shouted aloud, No! And let the o trail forever. She had not accepted, and I tried to delete my drunken mistake. It was sometime between then and now that she blocked me, and as I rise my head over the monitor to view the Skype webcam enshrined atop it, I think: she shall never see this beautiful face o' mine. He, Artheces, is the human born son of the dragon, the red robed disciple enchanted. He, Artheces, will channel the gold and treasures of his Majesty's Royal Treasury into the heavens by flying the gold past the clouds into the metaphysical space beyond. The only requirement the Kingdom places upon the dragon, Artheces, is that he forfeit his powers in the pursuit of conquering of the Kingdom until end of the twenty years. Once the ritual of the dragon is complete and the treasure flown into space, Artheces will be free to retreat into the mountainside to live in his palatial cave until the next debt is collected. As Champion of Earth, and future protector of the Kingdom, I have one request to make before my job begins. As you wish, said the disciple. Do not tell him I am the dragon he pays to protect his kingdom. Show me that string on the second chromosome, again. Measles. Despite choosing perfectly stupid candidates for domestication, the doctor furiously recounted to the telephone port, the DNA of the celebrities' faces is interfering with the Clone A Friends' consciousness! Well, is the entire line going to need to be recalled? Very good, Nagathor. I'm guessing three hours left, green text said on his monitor inside. There is nothing shocking to a superintelligence except the wet, it scrolled for the man to read. While man is shocked by simple things. Yes, your heart is going to fail shortly, the code ran, but I'm telling you, you're going to like the view when you get here. My conception of the devil was wrong, he said. The devil I anticipated, the dark, horned, toothy animal, wasn't quite what I saw through the lens of the Nat Geo photographer. Yes, it was the devil. But you don't want to hear 'bout that, he slurred, crouched beside the burning fire. Dy no mite, he said, squeezing a nearby trunk for support. That's what she said. Ha! Three, two, damn. Is that the mark of the beast? It is me, the Devil, and yes I'm dead. You have been granted immortality for killing me, but do you accept? Do not fear the Devil, came the voice as if from across a thousand rivers. You will become very close to him, indeed. For you, the Devil said, are going to be known as the grim reaper. I'm done, he said over the phone to his boss. I can't keep fighting to make it to the Millennial Kingdom anymore, since this second rapture thing has got to be the most ridiculous idea I've ever heard. I made it here with my stalwart darling, the astronaut said. Your stalwart darling, sir? I've made it this far by flying, sir. But there is no edge of the universe and the team thinks you've lost your mind out there in the blackness of space. No, it's the edge of the universe. That's the ticket! My stalwart darling; the one who wanted a Caesar. Are we noshing on foie gras? Yes, I suppose we are, she said suggestively. I was made to nosh this, but first I must state my objection to all force fed ducks and their force feeding for the purposes of fattening the liver and in that way torturing the ducks for their entire lives, mind you. Well, one of them is dimensional. Trees, it's the trees, friend. But where's my player select screen? You don't get one. Hey, there's faces in Minecraft. Your name is Malcovich, the dwarf said. Malcovich malcovich malcovich. Open up, they're coming, his wife said. Goodbye, Astra. Open. Let them in dear, his wife said, pretending the situation wasn't strange at all. How is the daughter? Getting her feed? Has she laid eggs, yet? Oh yes, she's our beautiful darling. Call the Norwegians! The bombs are coming, she screamed. Make it viral, was the command that every social media marketer hated to hear. Have you considered making the novelette into a video game? You could be viral in just a with the right Android app. A game. How must we code this app? You must code it with code itself, Caesar said. That will test your mettle. What code? The code is Dark Bat. I've never heard of that before, one brave business man said. Google it. I don't have the willpower, sir. Now get to voting, we haven't heard a peep from your group, yet! This is the way they skank! What is skank? It's a human dance, Sherald, the elder elf said. Not something the elves should try. Nonsense, said Ride, kicking up his elf boots. If you lean backward, your legs go higher. Skanking and rock'n'roll. Pinch hitter was an elven curse. I've always wanted to be a human, he said. Maybe if I change my name and start a band, elves will love me. For those about to rock, we salute you. Has no one any respect for the position that I'm titled with? No one has any respect for the position with which you're titled, sir, the agent said, leaning forward in the waiting seat. Then I offer a rubettal! What's your rebuttal, sir? Spam attack! Spam attack denied, sir. Full spam ahead, gentlemen. In the event of an emergency, Gerald will find you and take you down to ground level. Nothing comes without a price, Ivy said, wearing her green cape. The cost of immortality is death, my sad, sad little friend. The remote is an X box controller, I said into my earpiece to my dejected colleague. Use that to steer the tyrannosaurus rex. I'm on it, sir, Raven said. I am part of this team for a reason. She's going in through my bone marrow. Does that hurt? Calm yourself. He's on the cloud, she said,
 examining the square of his skin which had been removed. His distinctiveness has been manifested into the fold as part of the entire collective agency. I'm convinced you must worship me as God, he said to me one morning. But you know I'm an imp, or demon. I have something to explain to you, older baby child. I'm ... shocked at this news, Dad, and I don't think my outputs will ever be right again. I'm not your Dad, robot. When your name is Wii, it happens a lot. Wii, I'm so wii sorry. I said don't worry about it. But tying down every swear word into one word for every language. Not the only one. But he goes by another name, the fisherman said, pouring fish eggs out of the belly. Iiw, that's disgusting. I wii hate it when you give us your fake Australian accent. It's my only relief, Wii said dejectedly. Let them by, the police commissioner said in Japanese. They're the gay prefects. Stand back. Won't you join us, Mr. Notice the struggle. It appears the woman attempted to crush the bread on her attacker's body, then toppled backward. Have we ruled out accidental death, Detective Bradley? You're telling me we're here because a woman accidentally fell back in her chair and her face was caved in from eating too much bread, maybe? Detective. Welcome to a new era, brother. Would you murder one innocent person to cure world hunger? It must be done in hours. My purse contains many things that can help you. You must be insane. She'll be famous, the woman said in her supple voice. You made her famous. She only had to . But where's my man? She doesn't exist, the man said on the other end of the phone. She's not a person, Detective Bradley. I'll get back to you, Detective Bradley said. The murder of your world's innocence, she said. Hills and countries. Shush, you fool. Please, not more tales of the Shidave. Shidave, he is here. We must rope him. Rope him? Yes, rope him, like last time, The doctor followed the edge of the statue to the backside. Remarkable. Just take a scratching of the poem and let's load this thing up. One moment, the doctor said. Can you imagine how large the being inside must be? Yes, I said with a certain manner of derision. We learned that giants walked the Earth. Help me, he said. Shidave be damned. Jesus. Jesus, forgive me for I have sinned. Jesus, forgive me. Hello? My name is Bryan. Hi! W what? You're paranoid and you need to get help. And? You're not speaking to anyone of any importance. You know me so well. I'm sorry, John. Is that okay? Okay? Okay?! Okay! Say something else, ya nitwit, Steve muttered. I know you're capable of having a decent conversation. Okay! Is that okay? Mom, am I retarded? Oh come on! Mom, tell him so we can go to bed. Lucky I have you, he said laughing. Notice the way the man covers his ears, yet he cannot stop the sound. Robinson, the United States cannot depend on annoying its enemy to win the war. We could get them where it hurts. How can you justify wasting military resources on sending music into the heads of our enemy? You haven't heard this album, my friend. You see, the men in the other cells do not hear the music we are sending to our target. We cannot wait weeks. Do you intend to decimate the credibility of an entire country in a matter of moments? What's Randy's price for the override module? Ten thousand. My god, I can't imagine it being that expensive to make. It's very cheap to make. What's that? A pair of handcuffs. A frozen cup of tea? If the cup had been colder, the commander would have realized it was from his own chef. Yeah, said a third soldier. But why was the cup so warm? Some say it was a conspiracy to start an unending war. The strangeness of the warm cup is what started this war. The frozen tea prank was actually an alien conspiracy. But why do aliens want us to fight? Why wouldn't they? It is a mystery that the cup was warm. I heard it was slightly chilled from the tea, but not quite so frozen as if it had been in the freezer for a while. Then a man must have warmed it with his hands. I think aliens want us to kill each other. Wouldn't want another Tea Party Crusade on our hands, would we, Shimtavek? We might not be able to see you in a month. It is a regressive therapy, mom. You know nothing about it, Howard. We'll believe in a world of make believe. What have you been doing for the past few days? Just looking after what remained of humanity, sans bodies, Jeff said. And what was that? The empty husk of a forgotten soda can, falling in a ditch. I'm sorry you had to witness that, the officer said. I'm sorry, too. Disco Inferno.
 Marines don't die, one of the Wisps said. They just go to hell and regroup. Oh no! We're officially hell! We'll need a flare. Oh my god! Don't worry, babe. There's another behind the trees, Dad. Perfect. It's both of them, Sam said. We have both units. We got Angle , Gary. Why did I come? To see this, my boy! NarratingBot will be destroyed piece by piece like this until we're free. I Dream of Genie would work, because I was always hiding that I was gay to my friends. Want to rub it? You want a wish, Kevin? Don't you just rub the lamp? She'll come through for ya, my friend said. She? Genies don't answer all requests, anyway, Kevin. What? Sorry, bro. Who bequeaths me? Just me, I said. Do I get a wish, genie? Yes! I want to speak every language, I said. Your wish is my command. Wait, it worked! Lord save us. Odd, I thought, and had a maid clean it up. Pest! No, wait, mister! I'm from planet Erchon, and now that you know our language we must use you. Use me? And your little maid, too! I've never seen anything like it before! My God, it was full of stars! Gosh, Duke. Ho Ching, I don't think you want to try the skyscraper sauce roll. It's so beautiful! This means virtual war. What he plans to do is infiltrate the US TV Temple with his own televisions, and defeat the antichrist from the inside out. SELECTION: MASSIVE! I'd like a dip, first. Fine. Here's the snuff. Molecule grabbed. What from the lowest reaches of Hell is going on? You're telling the story of your death to the ones who killed you meaninglessly, the AI system said. Where are they taking me? They're taking your brain even though they don't know it's you to the language processing unit, or LPU a giant rack of supercolliding iron atoms with your brain at the center. What do they think they're doing with my brain? They think they're turning it into more crystal drug matter. What? We're sorry, but there is a window in which you can be reached. You Frost Nebula people can Freeze time, then? We're not... ... Superheroes... The entire class murmered in agreement. We know not to harvest molecules if and when we're giant space angels, Ms. Tartus. Jump into him, came Sarah's voice in my earpiece. Jump! You may know, or you may not, that we have something very powerful together. Every step of the way, every moment of this journey of finding our identity, I will stand by you. With each bouncing, bobbing thrust into the sensitive bubble of stock that represents your livelihood, we reach closer to climax. When the time is right, I want us to wait, and revel in the scent of each other's ultimate satisfaction. Coming within you is a raging hard on point exclamation that we are one in body and spirit. Sam. Get the fuck out of my head, Sam. Sam, I need to tell you the truth. Get the fuck out of my head, Sam! I'm about to drop something heavy on you ladies, he said. Every guy in this bar wants to screw their mom. What are you, Darwin or something? It's Freud. What do you want from me? We want to knock the f!&#ing paint off your stupid face! Then I challenge everyone here to a duel. Ha, ha! I'm going to get your nose! Survival of the fittest, bitch. It's annoying and unnerving. I suppose it's one of us though. For fuck's sake, who turned on the fan? It could be some kind of poltergeist. Poltergeists aren't real. James, what is that? Just something I found in this basement, James said. No big deal. James, what are you writing? I don't like your name, said the Archangel. You'll be Samsarah from now on. We're getting married, Samsarah. Oh my Go Janet was cut off by the deafening sound of flames. We're getting married in Hell. Memo from Aliester Smith, Mr. Bean. No, Ms. Ruth. . You're going to fire half the world. And that's the torture. You're a genius, Stacy said. People really think it's Hell, you know. Earth? You don't know where Earth is? Earth doesn't ring a bell. We think you're the Devil, and you steal souls on Earth and take them to Hell. You don't have it quite right. I thought you can never leave Hell. Oh, you can. Speak of the Devil, her guide said. You're back. The Devil seems pretty nice, actually. Hello, son. I see you're not selling weed anymore. How did you know I sold weed, Jim? Look, I know I may not seem like a good father to you, but I have been paying attention. Son, I want to sell weed with you, he said, as I was finishing up vacuuming. I know, I know you might think it's a bad idea. I'm not helping you, and I can't believe you came to ask me that! But son... I took all the good parts off my potato head memory of him, and I saw him as just a plain man. ...I want to branch out and meet new people. What the fuck? Oh my God! Give it up, he said. My business is online now, Caesar. Ave, Caezar. I am capable of commanding an army, yes, he said. But the war will be fought by robots, not humans. A war fought by lifeless copies of myself will reduce human casualties nearly per cent. We don't know the source of the bow and arrow, but the weapon will most surely kill your first wife. I am not doubting the bow, friends. Why yes, darling man. Race ya! Yet you've fallen behind in scruples, Janus, you American Prince, Picasso said. I know you couldn't finish me in a mural contest. May we all live in regret of wars past, and prevent wars in future even if we must transcend the present moment to change the future. Not a single one of them want help. You're under arrest! What are you doing, my colorful friend? Just keep it quiet around the others, will you? What, just what do you think you're doing speaking? I am not your shadow. The world is your shadow, that is? No, you are mine. Not now. But wa wa! I never get these moments to myself, John. Just as soon as we get out of here, I'm going to give you a tummy buzz! But what about the jogs we take in the morning? Those? What about the jogs? You get privacy on those. Yes, and I'm also running. Here comes Adam. What's up, guys? John, you see the news about the baby who won a lottery ticket? A baby won the lottery? No, a baby won a lottery ticket. Oh, is that legal? It isn't legal for a baby to purchase a lottery ticket, but if it's a prize, the baby is entitled to it unless it wins, in which case, yes, it's illegal. So what's the point? What the hell are you telling us for? Oh, there is no point. Thanks Adam. Miss! Miss! Ol' Wishingwater and I have been through great perils, young Soloflop. The flowers become wildly huge, East of the Yondermost, in the East Yon, out by a further bearing than normal East. The Sprigot Rabbits take home in honeyhive warrens throughout the land the greener part of the land, that is. The Sprigot Rabbits are only matched in invisibleness by the Paper Florist Flower Patch Kids, which are tiny little elves that live sourly under their flowers. And growing just slightly above the Paper Florist Flower Patch Kids were my prize, the Finistration Molecules. I'm dreaming this place of the dreaming herb, the place within the dreaming herb and the place I was just describing. This is war! I've come to bring you a huge idea, Commander Twain, the commander in chief of the ancient army said. I come to bring you to peace among nations. There will never be peace, Mark Twain said. Then I shellest thou hill. We'll need a dynamic plot, for example. For the last time, Jake, please leave. I think he's gone. Security? Security will respond in a moment. And until then, said Mr. Turner, second head of the company, just below CEO, I think we'll do a little of our own brainstorming. We have Jake. Everybody out of the building. We think you'll like your lawyer, Jake. I will rule the world with you, unconditionally. Just kidding. Excuse me, sorry. We don't want IN DOC TRI NATION! Heark! Unto me ye shall fall again. I am master of none, I tick tacked into the message box. I am only His Dark Companion.
