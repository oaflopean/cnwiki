Maybe if I change my name and start a band, elves will love me.
Maybe three years.
Maybe everyone needed to be zapped.
Maybe it was wrong to get the job after all, I thought.
Maybe raking in all that money wasn't right.
Maybe it could take his mind off things.
Maybe they wanted something more.
Maybe they were jealous of God.
Maybe if I change my name and start a band, elves will love me.
