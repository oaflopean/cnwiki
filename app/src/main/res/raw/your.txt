Your stalwart darling, sir?
Your name is Malcovich, the dwarf said.
Your suit of armor, your body, is your greatest advantage.
Your heart is an open book to me.
Your habits took over your life, and you became lifeless without me.
Your cell phone rings.
Your mom is expecting me.
Your wish is my command.
Your spirit won't be consumed.
Your stalwart darling, sir?
Your name is Malcovich, the dwarf said.
Your wish is my command.
