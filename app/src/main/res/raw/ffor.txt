For you, the Devil said, are going to be known as the grim reaper.
For thirty five something years, he dwelled as a bottom feeder, uncatchable, immortal.
For those about to rock, we salute you.
For fuck's sake, you're not retarded!
For fuck's sake, who turned on the fan?
For a moment, I thought we were bonding.
For a period of five minutes I will focus my rage, and then I will act.
For I will slay thee!
For the last time, Jake, please leave.
