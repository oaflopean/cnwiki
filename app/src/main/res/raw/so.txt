So far, we mental patients have stuck together.
So I was driving along, much later, in my sedan going from town to town with a special license that was given to me as a precursor to my pilot badge @IbbaCore.
So the problem remained: the human problem.
So my world seemed to be the light cast by my own shadow.
So what's the point?
So Samuel Langhorne Clemens, stripped of his reputation and influence, smoked a pipe, and laughed, and wrote these words down under a different pen name.
So when the nutcase gave is speech, ridiculing my great Fuhrur, and as the pape said, exposing a terrifying plan, I was exploding with rage.
So close.
So what's the point?
